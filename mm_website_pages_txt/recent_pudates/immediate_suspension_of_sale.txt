The Mohawk Mothers have sent formal notice to the City of Montreal and the government of Quebec demanding immediate suspension of the sale of the former Hôpital de la Miséricorde. As caretakers of Tionni’tio’tià:kon (Montreal), we are calling for an independent archival and field investigation to determine the likelihood of unmarked graves on the grounds of the hospital. 

We are also fighting to protect the Black Rock cemetery. Keep an eye out here for regular updates.
