      "A spokesperson for the Mohawk Mothers, or Kahnistensera, says the group feels pushed aside in the search for unmarked graves on a site owned by Société Québécoise des Infrastructures, or SQI. McGill says it leases part of the property.\n",
      "“The process can no longer by any means be considered Indigenous-led, as the SQI and McGill attempt to control the whole process, reducing the role of Indigenous people to performing ceremonies on the site,” said Kahentinetha, one of the Mothers who added that they feel blindsided by the communications that happened without consulting them.\n",
      "Quebec’s infrastructure society, or SQI, and McGill both put out statements on Aug. 3 saying nine potential gravesites were identified through ground penetrating radar, or GPR, without consulting the Kahnistensera.\n",
      "They excluded the information that, according to Geoscan’s report, “It is possible that some of the unknown features may be unmarked graves, particularly in the case of older burials without coffins and also possibly child-size graves.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha said that the archeologists on-site have been very informative, but there’s often a delay in the mothers receiving important reports.\n",
      "“The only way we can find out is to be right there, because we are not told and I don’t know why the material goes to them, and then they distribute it in the way they want and eventually we get a copy of it,” she said. “It seems like this is violating the court order.”\n",
      "They were present on-site when archeologists also dug up a woman’s dress and a pair of children’s shoes, the style dating back to around the 1940s.\n",
      "But the archeologist panel appointed in the settlement agreement said that they need to appoint a forensic specialist to handle these items, something the SQI has refused, said researcher Philippe Blouin.\n",
      "“That has been refused now, officially, even though it was a recommendation from the panel, and their recommendations are supposed to be binding, as per the settlement agreement. It’s been refused by the SQI,” he said.\n",
      "In an email statement to APTN News, the SQI stated that a bioarcheologist is present when archeological works are underway – but did not say whether they were trained in handling potentially criminal evidence.\n",
      "“The dress was found just a few inches inside the ground and then put in a plastic bag but it has to be a tamper-proof bag for it to stand in a criminal court. There are many chances that it is possible that this comes to a criminal court and this chain of custody has to be preserved for this prosecution to be successful,” said Blouin.\n",
      "Blouin said they also have left partially covered piles of dirt to sit in the rain since July 25 that was dug up where sniffer dogs detected the scent of human remains in early June.\n",
      "“The piles have not been sifted through, and that was also a recommendation from the panel that was not respected by the SQI to sift through these piles that were extracted from the site where the search dogs sniffed a target to sift through them immediately because the human remains could be inside these piles.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha said that in the midst of these recommendations being ignored, “Despite publicly stating their support for the process and commitment to reconciliation, McGill and SQI have unilaterally deemed the panel’s mandate terminated.”\n",
      "This would mean that archeological works would continue with the firm Ethnoscope, but they would be guided by McGill and SQI, rather than a panel of expert archeologists. The SQI stated that the archeologist’s panel had the mandate to submit two reports of recommendations, one being submitted on May 8 and the other on July 17. The SQI said they were “very satisfied by and grateful for the work accomplished by the experts.”\n",
      "The settlement agreement states, “SQI, McGill and the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera agree to be bound by the recommendations of the Panel as to the Techniques and agree to be guided by the recommendations of the Panel as to the specialists to carry out the techniques and analyse the relevant data, but McGill and SQI retain discretion to retain other providers with the appropriate qualifications and expertise if the circumstances warrant.”\n",
      "The Kahnistensera also don’t want to return to work until they have mohawk security guards after a security guard appointed by a private company hired by SQI kicked them off the grounds on July 25.\n",
      "“We need to have our own people to do the security. and we do have a group in Kahnawake ready to come and do it, and we’re working on bringing them in.”\n",
      "Archeological digs have been suspended since that incident.\n",
      "The SQI and McGill both said that dialogue is underway with the Kahnistensera. In an email statement to APTN, the SQI did not say whether they’d hire a Mohawk security form, but said the agents assigned to the site would receive “awareness training about Indigenous realities including a portion on residential schools and missing children” as well as “a specific training on Mohawk culture provided by the Mothers.”\n",
      "The Kanistensera and their allies are prepared to return to court if the SQI and McGill continue to breach the settlement agreement.}, {'metadata': {'title': 'mcgill-reports-nine-potential-grave-zones-at-new-vic-site-a-week-after-security-verbally-assaulted-mohawk-mothers', 'author': 'jasjot grewal', 'publisher': 'the tribune', 'URL': 'https://www.thetribune.ca/news/mcgill-reports-nine-potential-grave-zones-at-new-vic-site-a-week-after-security-verbally-assaulted-mohawk-mothers-04092023/', 'summary': 'summary', 'tags': ['news', 'student']}, 'text': \n",
      "On July 25, the Kanien’kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) were verbally assaulted by security personnel on McGill’s New Vic project site. A week later, on Aug. 3, McGill issued a comprehensive press release about the ongoing investigation into the New Vic project site, announcing that nine anomalies were found during archaeological work. However, the Mohawk Mothers soon released their own statement, alleging that McGill and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) had failed to report all the findings on the site and isolated the Mothers from the investigation. \n",
      "The Mothers have been present for the archaeological excavation on the New Vic site, alongside archaeologists and security personnel hired by SQI as stipulated by their settlement agreement with McGill, the SQI, the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), the City of Montreal, and the Attorney General of Canada. Court-appointed Indigenous cultural monitors—who are responsible for performing cultural ceremonies and ensuring that excavation is completed in accordance with Indigenous protocols—have also been present on the site.\n",
      "In an interview with The Tribune, Mohawk Mother Kwetiio shared that on the afternoon of July 25, the Mothers and cultural monitors were on the New Vic site taking a virtual meeting when archaeologists informed them that work would end earlier than usual that day. As the meeting was wrapping up, Kahentinetha, another of the Mothers, decided to walk up the hill on the New Vic site, prompted by one of the cultural monitors. \n",
      "“After we finished our meeting […], Kahentinetha was coming down the hill towards us from the security guards and said, ‘They’re calling the police.’ I was startled,” Kwetiio said. “I went up the hill […], and [a member of the Mothers’ team, Alex*] came along with me.” \n",
      "Alex pulled out their phone to record the interaction. However, when the pair got to the top of the hill, a security guard whose name remains unknown snatched Alex’s phone out of his hands.\n",
      "“She grabbed [the phone] and started hollering at [Alex] that ‘No, I’m not being filmed, and you have no right,’” Kwetiio said. “And here’s me being like, ‘Wait a minute, calm down, like there are older people here.’” \n",
      "The security guard then handed Alex’s phone to another security guard, who stopped the recording and deleted it from the device. Kwetiio explained that the interaction became increasingly hostile when the security guard told the Mothers that they were not allowed to be present on the property unless they had a court order and demanded that the Mothers show her the document. \n",
      "“I said, ‘[…] You’ve been here all week. I’m pretty sure you know who we are, and you know why we’re here. And if you give [Alex] back [their] phone, [they] can pull it up on our email, and you will see the court order,’” Kwetiio said. \n",
      "The security guard went on to threaten to call the police numerous times. In an interview with The Tribune, Mother Kahentinetha shared some of the remarks the security guard made toward the Mothers. \n",
      "“[The security guard] says, ‘You should have some kids to take care of,’ or something like that. I said, ‘We had kids, but they ended up here in McGill and they were tested on.’ She says, ‘That’s a lie, that’s a lie.’ And I said, ‘Well, that did happen, and you got the benefit from this.’ And that’s when she said, ‘Yes, we sure did. We got the benefits,’” Kwettio said. \n",
      "The security firm did not respond to The Tribune’s request for comment. \n",
      "Since the altercation, the cultural monitors have refused to be present for additional work on the site until a resolution is reached. As the monitors must be present for any onsite work, the archaeological efforts were halted on July 26 but resumed Aug. 23.  \n",
      "A private meeting to discuss the altercation took place on Aug. 1, with the Mothers, the SQI, cultural monitors, and a representative of the Office of the Independent Special Interlocutor, Kimberly Murray, present. The Mothers pleaded with the defendants to hire a Kahnawake-based security firm to patrol the site, which was initially met with resistance from the defendants. However, all parties are in ongoing negotiations to potentially hire a Mohawk security firm. Currently, an SQI-appointed security firm continues to oversee the project’s security, while two representatives from a security firm chosen by the Mothers are also to be present on the site. \n",
      "While work remains halted after the altercation, ground penetrating radar (GPR)—a non-intrusive method of surveying and mapping land—has already been used on the site. On Aug. 3, McGill Provost and Vice Principal Christopher Manfredi issued a press release to all students and staff informing them that the GPR was performed by Geoscan—a geophysical archaeological firm that was recommended by the appointed panel of archaeologists. He shared that GeoScan’s findings have deemed that “no likely grave-type features [were] identified across the site,” but that nine anomalies, containing potential grave-type features, were found. \n",
      "According to anthropologist and associate of the Mothers, Phillipe Blouin, McGill’s announcement failed to include numerous additional findings. He explained that while only the nine reported anomalies were the correct size to be potential adult burial sites, several others of different sizes  were omitted from the press release. \n",
      "“There’s a much larger number of unknown anomalies [where] it’s possible that there are graves of children or graves without coffins,” Blouin said. “These results have been squarely silenced, denied, and minimized by the SQI.” \n",
      "SQI asserted that they have not denied or minimized the results of Geoscan’s report in a written statement to The Tribune. They stated that Geoscan indicated that the features of the “unknown anomalies” are not necessarially indicative of graves. \n",
      "In an interview with The Tribune, Associate Provost Angela Campbell explained that the reason McGill’s press release did not include the unknown anomalies was because the nine conclusive findings were of the most interest to the McGill community. The additional discoveries were highly unlikely to be potential graves, and were not definite findings. \n",
      "“[Our press release] wanted to communicate things that were certain,” Campbell said. “What was certain is that there’s nine potential unmarked sites, and so that’s where the work would begin [….] There’s no denying that there were many [findings] that were called an unknown source.”\n",
      "Blouin explained that the panel of archaeologists wanted to review and characterize the found anomalies, in addition to allowing the Canadian Archaeological Association (CAA) to peer review the data. However, the service providers would not allow this. \n",
      "SQI argued that the panel of archaeologists’ mandate was limited to identifying the appropriate archaeological techniques for the site and recommending service providers to carry out such techniques. They stated that it was never agreed upon to allow the panel to review or interpret the data obtained by the GPR. \n",
      "Additionally, Campbell explained that Geoscan was a service provider recommended by the panel of archaeologists. She also stated that as GeoScan is one of the most qualified archaeological firms in the country, she felt that it should be entrusted with the interpretation of GPR findings. \n",
      "“We need to be able to trust that company to collect and interpret their own data,” Campbell said.\n",
      "“That’s the reason why we don’t feel that we ought to subject the data to a second review. That company has the expertise, and we have to have the confidence in them to do that work.” \n",
      "While the investigation was halted, excavated soil remained above ground, which the Mothers worried could be damaged by weather conditions. \n",
      "“That is soil that is supposed to be sifted for human bones, and it’s left to the rain [….] It’s extremely improper for any type of archaeological inventory, and even more when there’s potential criminal ramifications and forensics,” Blouin said. \n",
      "In an interview with The Tribune, Executive Director of the New Vic project Pierre Major clarified that while the soil left on top of the land has been documented and covered with tarps during the investigation’s halt, the soil is unlikely to contain evidence. \n",
      "Direct excavation has resumed in recent weeks in the areas flagged by search dogs. However, the Mothers still feel there is a lack of sufficient communication and cooperation from the defendants. \n",
      "“The SQI and McGill are taking every little grey area that we haven’t created a protocol for, and they’re using those grey areas to try and take over the investigation and not make it Indigenous-led,” Kwetiio said. }, {'metadata': {'title': 'Concern About Recent Actions', 'author': 'Mohawk Mothers', 'publisher': 'Mohawk Mothers', 'URL': 'https://www.mohawkmothers.ca/recent-updates/5mrgjgp3uuxxrc62ns37lck7pswger', 'summary': 'This press release discusses the recent tone of discourse, including several incidents and reports related to the search for unmarked graves and the treatment of Mohawk Mothers.', 'tags': ['indigenous']}, 'text': \n",
      "The Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) are deeply concerned about McGill and the Société Québécoise des Infrastructures’ (SQI) recent actions in the archaeological search for unmarked burials at the New Vic site.\n",
      "Despite publicly stating their support for the process and commitment to reconciliation, McGill and SQI have unilaterally deemed the panel’s mandate terminated, without following through on several recommendations which they agreed to be bound by in the Settlement Agreement signed in April 2023 and homologated in the Quebec Superior Court.\n",
      "McGill and the SQI have recently rejected recommendations from the Panel to include a forensics expert to oversee the chain of custody of artefacts, which is an essential aspect of a credible investigation. The Settlement Agreement had resulted from an injunction won by the Mohawk Mothers in October 2022 halting the New Vic construction project to allow an “Indigenous-led” investigation of unmarked graves. The process can no longer by any means be considered “Indigenous-led”, as the SQI and McGill attempt to control the whole process, reducing the role of Indigenous people to performing ceremonies on the site. One panel member has put forth her resignation in the wake of these troubling developments.\n",
      "Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha declared the turn of events “deplorable”, while Mohawk Mother Kwetiio stated that “it is very unfortunate that the SQI, as a public institution from Quebec, prefers to invest the population’s money in keeping Indigenous elders from discovering the truth about what happened to their children by fighting them in court. We were hoping for an amicable and open dialogue to resolve the disagreements in implementing the Settlement Agreement, but it is not acceptable to our people that Quebec and McGill entirely control an investigation searching for the unmarked graves of potential victims of those institutions in the past.”\n",
      "On August 3rd, 2023, McGill University and the SQI published newsletters disclosing part of the results of a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey performed by Geoscan on July 24, 2023, which we received the day before August 2nd, 2023. The newsletters are attached to this press release. The SQI and McGill did not consult the Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) before making it public.\n",
      "The two newsletters sent to the general public and media contain misleading information that must be corrected. The SQI’s newsletter suggests that “to date, no burials have been found” after the manual searches of the area where search dogs detected the scent of human remains. This fails to mention the discovery of important evidence in the soil excavated until now, including a young woman’s dress and an old pair of children leather shoes. They also fail to mention the verbal attack of Mohawk cultural monitors and elders on the site last week, who were evicted and verbally aggressed by unidentified security guards under the direction of the SQI, who also illegally grabbed someone’s telephone to erase the content of a video that was taken.\n",
      "Regarding the GPR report, the SQI and McGill’s newsletters mislead the public into believing that only nine (9) anomalies were found in the rather small zone that has been surveyed so far, the “priority zone” where they want to start construction work. A far greater number of “unknown” targets were detected by the GPR team, who suggest that “It is possible that some of the unknown features may be unmarked graves, particularly in the case of older burials without coffins and also possibly child-size graves.” The burials currently being searched for following the testimonies of survivors of medical experiments at the former hospital are those of children who would likely have been clandestinely buried without coffins.}, {'metadata': {'title': 'Mohawk Mothers Win Injunction Against McGill at David and Goliath Hearing', 'author': 'emelia fournier', 'publisher': 'aptn news', 'URL': 'https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/mohawk-mothers-win-injunction-against-mcgill-at-david-and-goliath-hearing/', 'summary': 'This article reports on the victory of Mohawk mothers who won an injunction against McGill University in a significant legal hearing.', 'tags': ['news', 'indigenous']}, 'text': \n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers, or Kanien’kehà:ka Kanistansera, obtained a temporary injunction against McGill University to stop the renovation and excavation of a hospital where group says unmarked graves are located.\n",
      "“I feel like I just had a new baby, I do, because I feel like we’re closer to having our future generations heard, our past generations heard, and whatever has happened to our children, that they have purpose,” said Kwetiio, one of the Mothers.\n",
      "Kwetiio, Kahentinetha and Karennatha represented themselves in court against several lawyers representing the defendants: McGill University, Société québécoise des infrastructures, the City of Montreal and the Attorney General of Canada, among others.\n",
      "“You’ve never seen a case like this because there hasn’t been one. And quite frankly, the fact that Indigenous people can get justice in a courtroom is, it just goes to prove that we’re not completely shut out, but it does take extraordinary measures,” said lawyer Donald Worme, who, along with lawyer Julian Falconer, were present at the hearing as legal counsel for Kimberly R. Murray, the Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools.\n",
      "Calling themselves “traditional custodians of the land,” they presented their evidence before the court, including testimony from MK-Ultra psychological experiments survivor Lana Ponting, who said she had seen Indigenous children at the hospital when she was there and witnessed clandestine grave-digging in her affidavit.\n",
      "They also presented research detailing the historic use of Indigenous children for medical experiments throughout the 20th century.\n",
      "The judge said he hoped that this temporary injunction would allow more time for parties to engage in discussion so that the voices of the Kanistansera could be heard, and potentially pursue non-invasive modes of the archeological survey so the evidence would not be destroyed.\n",
      "“The Mohawk Mothers took the weight of this on their shoulders without legal representation. The number of government parties in the room? Mind-boggling,” said Falconer.\n",
      "“What came out of all of this is probably one of the most striking David and Goliath stories I have seen in a long time.”\n",
      "Arkéos, the archeological firm hired by McGill to undertake an archeological survey of the grounds, had been digging on the site with a bobcat two weeks before the injunction ruling was made.\n",
      "Two weeks prior to the Mohawk Mothers’ injunction hearing, the firm said that the likelihood of unmarked graves was “very low.”\n",
      "However, Karohia’no:ron Dallas Canady-Binette, a Mohawk archeology student from Kanesatake, said that the project failed to properly include Indigenous consent.\n",
      "“A big issue for me is that the Kanistansera at least have said that what they prefer is non-invasive methods. And they’ve said that several times that they’d prefer ground-penetrating radar, LIDAR, or aerial surveillance to be used as opposed to starting to dig,” he said.\n",
      "There is also evidence that the site might have been home to a pre-colonial Iroquois village, something a 2016 Arkéos study also indicated.\n",
      "Karohia’no:ron wrote an op-ed in the McGill Tribune criticizing Arkéos’ past archeological survey of those grounds. In 2016, McGill administration hired Arkéos to determine whether construction on the New Vic site would destroy any archeological artifacts — but failed to consult with any Indigenous people or use any Indigenous sources.\n",
      "“What [Arkéos] did do is consult historical documents, they consulted geographical data about the environment, what kind of soil, stuff like that. They also constructed building, like planning documents from the city of Montreal, but there was no Indigenous perspective. They didn’t consult any knowledge keepers, they didn’t consult any documents even that were written by Indigenous peoples and specifically kanie’keha’ka,” said Karohia’no:ron.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers repeated that no kaniekehaka consent was given for the New Vic project.\n",
      "The Mohawk Council of Kanawake (MCK) was consulted, but as Chief Ross Montour from MCK told APTN News in a phone interview, McGill’s campus falls out of MCK jurisdiction. MCK is therefore unable to either approve or veto a project.\n",
      "Mountour said the council was kept up-to-date with developments on the land, and mentioned that two First Nations representatives from Akwesasne were overseeing Arkéos’s archeological survey.\n",
      "These digs sparked resistance from some McGill students, including the student executive and McGill’s Divest student group.\n",
      "Val Masny, vice-president (external) of McGill’s student executive felt the university was rushing the process.\n",
      "“If there’s even like a one percent chance that there are unmarked graves, we need to do things properly. Like to me it’s not a question of probability, it’s just a question of doing things the right way,” said Masny.\n",
      "McGill students rallied outside the Montreal courthouse in solidarity with the Mohawk Mothers on Oct. 26 and many were present in the courtroom.\n",
      "But not everyone in kanawake feels represented by the Mohawk Mothers.\n",
      "APTN spoke with Debbie Delisle, a Mohawk Mother of the Turtle Clan, prior to the judges’ ruling. She’s also the elder in residence for McGill’s social work program.\n",
      "“Everybody has a right to express whatever, and however. Is an injunction [right]? Not really, because they haven’t spoken to me. They haven’t presented their issue to the community. Can we invite the community to a gathering so we can express our concerns about it,” said Delisle.\n",
      "Delisle said she would be willing to engage with the Mohawk Mothers provided they are open to discussion.\n",
      "McGill did not respond to APTN’s request for comment and Arkeos was not available for an interview before deadline.\n",

      "Pope Francis’s landmark apology over residential schools drew sharp criticism from Indigenous spokespeople in Montreal — with one Mohawk women’s group even calling for the cross on Mount Royal to be taken down as an act of contrition.\n",
      "On Wednesday, two days after apologizing in Edmonton to Indigenous Peoples for the role the Roman Catholic Church played in Canada’s residential school system, the pontiff expressed his “deep shame and sorrow” and sought forgiveness for “the wrong done by so many Christians” during an address in Quebec City. He has described the Canadian trip as his “penitential” journey.\n",
      "Although he branded the forced cultural assimilation of First Nations children a “deplorable evil” and “disastrous error,” Pope Francis hasn’t mentioned sexual abuse in his remarks since landing in Canada. He also hasn’t brought up the so-called Doctrine of Discovery, a centuries-old decree from the Vatican that countries such as Canada used to justify the colonization of Indigenous lands.\n",
      "“If everybody thought that was a solution, that apology, they all would have been there,” Kwetiio, a Kahnawake resident and spokesperson for a group known as the Mohawk Mothers, told reporters Wednesday in Mount Royal Park. “There’s no way you could drag me there. That’s what I think about that apology. It’s empty.”\n",

      "On November 20, 2023, Justice Gregory Moore issued a judgment ordering McGill University and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) to abide by the Settlement Agreement they had signed with the self-represented Indigenous plaintiffs on April 6, 2023, and to respect the recommendations of the Expert Panel of archaeologists they had jointly selected.\n",
      "Justice Moore’s judgement states that the SQI’s and McGill’s positionending the Expert Panel’s mandate on July 17th is “too restrictive,” asthe settlement agreement “does not set a term for the panel’sinvolvement in the on-going search for unmarked graves” (par 34).According to the Judge, “The delay and costs of the overall projectcannot justify the SQI’s and McGill’s unilateral reduction of theirobligations under the settlement agreement, especially when doing sowill cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs” (par. 39).\n",
      "For Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha, the Judgement is a relief. “We’ve fought so hard for two years to search for these missing children. Our community was targeted by genocide and our children were used as guinea pigs in these horrific experiments by the CIA to see how to kill the Indian in them. But since McGill and the SQI fired the Expert Panel we had no way to keep track and trust the results of the investigation, which was now being controlled by the perpetrators of crimes against our children. The point in signing the Settlement Agreement was to allow the experts to do their job, and we were betrayed. We had to do it all alone without lawyers, facing such powerful institutions. It wasn’t easy, but we made it. The Judge understood that the only way this can go is in a professional way, with independent experts to oversee everything and make sure our community is informed.”\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers submitted that McGill and the SQI had failed to implement numerous recommendations of the Expert Panel, notably refusing to share data from Ground Penetrating Radar surveys, refusing to adopt forensic precaution to protect the chain of custody of evidence, and depriving the Mohawk Mothers of access to crucial information such as contracts with specialists. Justice Gregory Moore found in favor of the Mohawk Mothers’ argument that the purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to rely on an independent and impartial Expert Panel to provide ongoing recommendations, in order to ensure that the New Vic Project would not result in the desecration of human remains, which survivors and search dogs indicated to be on the site.\n",
      "In August 2023, McGill and the SQI fired the Expert Panel, one of whom had recently resigned, after they asked to implement forensic measures and peer review data from Ground Penetrating Radar.\n",
      "Although Historic Human Remains Detection Dogs had detected the scent of human remains in the area in front of the Hersey Pavilion, McGill and the SQI declared that there was no evidence of burials there, suggested it was a false positive, and started large-scale non archaeological excavation in the zone. The Mohawk Mothers were concerned that development work in the area could start before the source of human remains in the zone was established, especially inside the Hersey Pavilion, because the dogs signaled remains next to the building's wall and because unexplained demolition work took place there.\n",
      "Justice Moore’s court ruling will allow for the independent Expert Panel to provide updated recommendations regarding the zone and the larger site, after being cut off from the investigation since August.\n",
      "On November 5, 2023, search dogs detected the scent of human remains in yet another zone, close to the Allan Memorial Institute where the CIA’s MK-Ultra experiments on brainwashing took place in the 1950’s and 1960’s.\n",
      "The parties will be back in court on December 1st to address a motion ordering the release of records withheld by the defendants.\n",

      "McGill also says the joint effort includes support for archival research and the appointment of a panel of expert archaeologists who will scan the site to determine appropriate techniques for archaeological work prior to the resumption of excavation at the site.\n",

      "“McGill University hopes that this agreement will serve as a backdrop for continued collaboration with Indigenous communities based on mutual trust and respect.”\n",

A portion of the property had been surveyed and HHRDDs had been recommended as a potential tool by a panel of 3 archaeologists (PRELIMINARY REPORT of the mapping mandate,Old Royal-Victoria Hospital site) Specifically, dog teams were tasked to search zones 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 15, as identified in the above report.\n",
      "Three HHRDD teams were used in the search. All three teams are currently certified in Human Remains Detection by the North American Police Work Dog Association. Each dog searched the entire assigned area once. Specifically, each dog team searched the entirety of Zones 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 15.No handler watched any of the other dog teams work. As such, no handler had any knowledge of another team’s results before searching themselves ie the search was ‘blind’ for all.When detecting a target odour, dogs may give alerts and/or a trained Final Response (TFR). An alert is defined by the Scientific Working Group on Dogs and Orthogonal Detection (SWGDOG) as “A characteristic change in ongoing behaviour in response to a trained odour, as interpreted by the handler.” A TFR is defined as “A behaviour that a dog has been trained to exhibit in the presence of a target odour source. During this search, handlers were to record both alerts and TFRs. After all three teams had completed their search, handlers would then compare their results and observations.\n",
      "All alerts noted by handlers were worked until they concluded in a TFR.All three dog teams reported a TFR in the same location, +/- 2m. The coordinates for this TFR (red dot on image below) are:\n",
      "Given that three separate dog teams indicated the same location independently with a TFR, we are confident that the odour of human remains is in this area.The wind direction, the building wall adjacent to the indications, the presence of an alcove, could suggest that odour is being blown into/contained at the location of the TFRs. Dogs indicate the area of strongest odour, which is not always the location of the source of the odour. The source of the odour could be right where the indications happened or could be further out from the building in an upwind direction. However, the further odour travels on the wind the more it spreads into a wider cone. The proximity of all dogs’ indications suggests that, if odour is being blown into the alcove area, it is not being blown in from a significant distance. We can only guess at what ‘significant’ means in this context, but a reasonable guess would be 10m or less.}, {'metadata': {'title': \"McGill's Royal Vic plans prompt call to check for unmarked graves\", 'author': \"T'Cha Dunlevy\", 'publisher': 'montreal gazette', 'URL': 'https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/mcgills-royal-vic-plans-prompt-call-to-check-for-unmarked-graves', 'summary': 'This article discusses the call for McGill University to check for unmarked graves at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, in light of their redevelopment plans.', 'tags': ['news']}, 'text': \n",
      "A group called the Mohawk Mothers (kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera) is demanding “the immediate suspension” of McGill University’s expansion plan for the old Royal Victoria Hospital site, and an investigation into the possibility there could be unmarked graves of Indigenous children there.\n",
      "The group claims to have recently interviewed Lana Ponting, an 80-year-old woman who says she was subjected to psychiatric experiments by Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron at McGill’s Allan Memorial Institute, in April 1958, at the age of 16. The woman reportedly said there were many Indigenous children at the Institute, and also that there were rumoured to be bodies buried around the premises, including near the Henry William Morgan Pool.\n",
      "Dr. Cameron subjected hundreds of patients to experiments between 1948 and 1964, using massive amounts of mind-altering drugs and repeated bouts of electroconvulsive shock therapy. The experiments were funded by the Canadian government and, in part, by the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency, which was funnelling money to mind-control research around the continent. The Mohawk Mothers highlighted the period between 1954 and 1963, when experiments were conducted as part of the CIA’s MKUltra program.\n",
      "“First of all, there are Iroquois villages (under) there,” said Kahentinetha, a spokesperson for the Mohawk Mothers. “So we want to investigate that and ask questions about it.\n",
      "“Those are our children that would be in unmarked graves. Several people who had been (at the Allan Memorial Institute) at the time in the ’50s and ’60s told us they themselves had seen Indigenous children there.”\n",
      "Part of the group’s contention is that McGill and the Royal Victoria Hospital site are on unceded Indigenous land. The group sent a letter of objection to McGill principal and vice-chancellor Suzanne Fortier in 2015, stating the university was built on Indigenous land without consent, using “unrepaid borrowed Iroquois trust funds,” but received no response from McGill.\n",

      "The Kahnistansera allege that there is a strong possibility that bodies of Indigenous children who they say were victims of botched psychiatric experiments are buried on the grounds of the Allan Memorial Institute (AMI), a former psychiatric hospital which is owned by McGill.   \n",
      "After a settlement agreement was reached in April, archeological works began to determine whether human remains were present on-site.\n",
      "At the case management hearing June 29, the Kanistensera and the special interlocutor on unmarked graves’ legal representation, Julian Falconer, stated that the settlement agreement was not sufficient to address these new developments.\n",

      "While McGill and SQI said they were following the procedures outlined in the agreement by following the advice of the panel of archeologists, Falconer said “the [archeology] panel expressly stated they don’t have expertise on security recommendations” to prevent the site from being disturbed.\n",
      "Additionally, the Kanistensera said their cultural monitors have not seen the promised 24-hour surveillance of the site in question at McGill. One cultural monitor, Karonhia’nó:ron Dallas Binette of Kanesatake, said that during the archeological foot survey of the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital in May, he and the archeologists noticed recently disturbed ground behind the Ross Pavillion.\n",
      "“There were artifacts that were disturbed, mainly related to a dump behind the Ross Pavilion, but grounds being disturbed,” said Karonhia’nó:ron.\n",
      "“There was evidence of non-authorized persons being able to freely walk around the Royal Victoria and Allan Memorial site,” he said.\n",
      "Karonhia’nó:ron said that on June 9, “while the [cadaver] dogs were working, pedestrians were able to encroach on their space. This didn’t affect the work of the dogs, but just in terms of respecting the site archeologically. More needs to be done to protect the integrity of the land and people’s spirits.”\n",
      "The Kanistensera contested McGill’s claims that there has been sufficient security increased after the findings of the sniffer dogs.\n",
      "There are also concerns over the speed of handing over archival records. In the settlement agreement, the MUHC, McGill, and the Library and Archives Canada are supposed to expedite access to relevant archival records on those who may have attended the Allan Memorial Institute and been subject to the MK-ULTRA experiments to Know History, an independent history firm.\n",
      "However, the panel has only been contracted for six months to advise on archeological works on the proposed New Vic site.\n",
      "“If you don’t have access to the records in a timely way, then conclusions are tainted by that. You’re operating essentially in the blind. And so this accelerated timeline has meant the need for accelerated access to records and that’s not happening,” said Falconer in a post-hearing interview with APTN News.\n",
      "While MUHC, McGill and Library and Archives Canada stated they were in the process of handing over records, Falconer said he had received communication from Know History that cooperation was “not what it could be.”\n",
      "“What the defendants described in the case management meeting was their interpretation of how things are progressing,” said Falconer. “What I can tell you is we are getting reports directly back from Know History that simply don’t support that, as we indicated in court.”\n",
      "Judge Gregory Moore gave the Kanistensera three options: to expand the panel to include expertise in site security; to revisit the mediation process between the defendants and plaintiffs and possibly modify the settlement agreement; or to begin a litigation process against the defendants.\n",

      "The Kahnistensera filed an Emergency Motion to halt drilling and excavation at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, which will be heard on Thursday September 14 at the Superior Court in Montreal. The Emergency Motion details breaches to the Settlement Agreement by McGill and the SQI that the Mohawk Mothers repeatedly raised in direct talks about significant concerns with the way they are handling the archaeological investigation ordered by the Quebec Superior Court to search for unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera are shocked and disappointed that McGill University and the Société Québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) have pressed ahead with construction on September 11, 2023 by drilling a large number of holes marking the beginning of a series of excavations. \n",
      "The same day, McGill University issued a message to all its staff and students, declaring that the investigation of the zone where they want to start work is complete, and produced no evidence of graves. The Mohawk Mothers see these developments as major provocations, as the investigation is far from complete and McGill’s messaging predominantly emphasizes favourable findings while concurrently concealing or downplaying several discoveries that confirm the possibility of unmarked burials at the New Vic site.

      "Following the recent discovery of the scent of human remains by Historic Human Remains Detection Dogs (HHRDD) on the grounds of the old Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) appeal to McGill University and the Government of Quebec to apply the same precautions for protecting potential remains on other similar sites. \n",
      "“It is our understanding that several other institutions in Quebec may contain unmarked graves of our children, not only in Indian Residential Schools or hospitals, but also in former sanatoria, orphanages and correctional homes,” said Kwetiio, one of the Mohawk Mothers. The Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera have obtained the first injunction ever granted to self-represented Indigenous people on October 27th, 2022, halting excavation work for McGill’s “New Vic” Project in the former Royal Victoria Hospital to search for unmarked graves following the testimonies of survivors of the MK-Ultra psychiatric experiments on mind control. During the hearing, McGill University and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) had started excavating the very same area where the dogs now found human remains, declaring that nothing had been found by archaeologists and that the New Vic construction project could begin. \n",
      "According to the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera, it is very likely that the human remains would have been destroyed by construction work if they did not intervene in court, despite lacking resources and legal assistance. “We should not have to go to court for this. Taxpayer money should not be spent on litigation against survivors and their family members who want to identify, protect and investigate the unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments”, says Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha, “they should collaborate from the onset to treat human remains with respect as responsible institutions would do”. The human remains were independently detected by three separate HHRDD handled by Kim Cooper, of the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association,on June 9, 2023, following a lengthy court process which led to a Settlement Agreement being homologated by the Superior Court of Quebec on April 20, 2023. \n",
      "Kimberly Murray, the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burials Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools, who intervened in the court proceedings, noted in her recently released Interim Report that “There is a need to expand the scope of research beyond Indian Residential Schoolsites.... Current investigations are beginning to reveal how the systems and patterns of colonial violence that existed in the Indian Residential School system extended to [other]associated institutions. ...Understanding the full scope of the forced transfer of children from one institution to the next and the conditions that led to their deaths will require significant time, funding, research, and long-term commitment to finding the truth.”\n",
      "TheMohawk Mothers urge McGill University and the McGill University Health Center to pause excavation work and large-scale renovation plans for hospitals and medical research centers who may contain the graves of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children as test subjects in the past. This includes not only the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, but also its main campus in downtown Montreal, where Iroquoian Longhouses and gravesites were repeatedly discovered, including at the intersection of Peel and Sherbrooke streets in 2018. On June 30th, 2023, the day following a court date where the HHRDD discovery was discussed, the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera were shocked to learn that McGill University had launched large-scale archaeological inventories next to the McLennan Library. McGill had not informed the Kahnistensera even though they had repeatedly expressed their vested interest in protecting the remains of their ancestors buried under the university in court. McGill University did not express whether Indigenous monitors and specialists in human burials were present at the archaeological site.\n",
      "Regarding the more recent remains of medical experiments, the Mohawk Mothers are concerned that Quebec is not taking its responsibility regarding the widespread abuse of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children such as the Duplessis Orphans in the past century. The Mohawk Mothers recently asked the Quebec government and the CIUSSS to halt the sale of the Hôpital de la Miséricorde, a former house for unwed mothers, to investigate the probability that it contains human remains; a meeting with the CIUSSS to discuss the demand will take place in Kahnawake on July 6th, 2023. “But we can’t run after the government all the time to make sure none of these sites where medical cruelty happened get desecrated or sold to get rid of them and the terrible evidence of the past they contain, says Kahentinetha. According to the Kahnistensera, the same type of agreement and investigation that resulted from the Royal Victoria Hospital Court Case should be followed in all other similar sites.\n",

      "Cadaver dogs conducting a search on the grounds of the Old Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal have discovered evidence of human remains, according to a new report.\n",
      "A group of Indigenous elders alleges that the site contains unmarked graves of Indigenous children who died as a result of mind-control experiments that took place in the 1950s and 1960s at a psychiatric institute affiliated with the former hospital.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers obtained an injunction last October(opens in a new tab) to pause excavation work done by McGill University at the site to expand its campus with a new research, teaching and learning hub. Both sides agreed in April to conduct a search for potentially unmarked graves(opens in a new tab).\n",
      "On Thursday, a report presented to the Quebec Superior Court said a team of three trained search dogs have pinpointed an area on the site possibly containing human remains near the Hersey Pavilion, a nurses' residence.\n",
      "\"Given that three separate dog teams indicated the same location independently with a TFR [Trained Final Response], we are confident that the odour of human remains is in this area,\" the report by the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association stated.\n",
      "A German Shepherd, a Dutch Shepherd, and a Malinois searched the site on June 9, alongside their dog handlers, archeologists and two Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera cultural monitors.Julian Falconer, a lawyer for the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools, an intervenor in the legal proceedings, was appointed to oversee the search.\n",
      "\"It's very important to understand it doesn't necessarily mean that there are human bodies located in the area all three teams identified, but certainly their function is to identify a specific odour and a target area, and these three sets of dogs did,\" he said in an interview Thursday.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers claim that they have evidence of graves from a survivor of the MK-Ultra mind-control experiments conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute on the Royal Victoria grounds.\n",
      "Canada and the CIA allegedly funded harmful psychological experiments(opens in a new tab) on vulnerable patients that included experimental drugs and rounds of electroshock therapy.\n",
      "The cadaver dogs' discovery is a major development in the construction project saga, which the Mohawk Mothers have been opposing since 2015.\n",
      "\"Of course, this has done nothing but multiply the anxiety and concerns of the Mohawk Mothers. And what you're seeing now playing out in real time and played out in court today is the level of upset this causes,\" Falconer said.\n",
      "Kwetiio, a Mohawk Mother, told CTV News that in an ideal scenario, there would be no unmarked graves on the grounds of the former hospital, but the recent discovery does provide some \"relief\" to Indigenous people that what they've been saying all along is likely true.\n",
      "\"They feel validated, that it's not just talk that they were saying, that is actually concluded to something. That relief, that comfort of knowing that somebody listened and did something about it and that we're gonna address it. It's going to be dealt with,\" Kwetiio said.\n",
      "She said Indigenous elders advocating for the work to be halted will be meeting in the coming days to decide the next steps.\n",

      "A Quebec Superior Court judge, Justice Gregory Moore, granted the Kanien’kehà:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) an interlocutory injunction on Oct. 27, after a two-day court hearing for the Mothers’ ongoing lawsuit against McGill over potential unmarked Indigenous graves on McGill’s New Vic site. This injunction will effectively halt all archeological work for approximately four months. \n",
      "An interlocutory injunction is a court order that prevents a party from performing certain actions until the final decision in a case has been made. In this case, McGill is still allowed to perform maintenance work on the site, but is prohibited from conducting any further excavation. Arkéos, the archeological firm hired by McGill, had begun excavation without the Mothers’ consent on Oct. 12.\n",
      "In an interview with The McGill Tribune, anthropologist and associate of the Mothers, Philippe Blouin, emphasized that the Mothers’ win is a historic achievement that establishes an important legal precedent. \n",
      "“It’s the first time in Canadian history that Indigenous people won without lawyers. This will be jurisprudence for future cases,” Blouin said. \n",
      "The two-day hearing saw arguments from both the Mothers and McGill, as well as Independent Special Interlocutor Kimberly Murray. The Mothers gave a presentation on the historical background of the case and recounted their past efforts. Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha also criticized McGill’s communication with the Mothers, which she described as negligent. \n",
      "“The only information we get is from McGill University’s Instagram photo-ops,” Kahentinetha said in court. \n",
      "Kahentinetha told the Tribune that during the proceedings, she voiced her frustration with McGill’s constant dismissal of the Mothers and their methods for handling the court case. Now that the judge has granted the injunction, she is looking forward to non-hostile discussions with McGill in the future. \n",
      "“We told them that we feel like we are being silenced,” Kahentinetha said. “We explained our frustration with the way we thought we were being mistreated, but it was basically a misunderstanding between us. And now, we’re going to be able to explain to them how we operate, which is very exciting.” \n",
      "McGill’s attorney, Doug Mitchell, debated with Murray and the Mothers over whether the Superior Court of Quebec was the appropriate setting for adjudicating this case. The Mothers countered that they had exhausted all channels outside of the court to express their concerns, and argued that the courtroom was their last resort.\n",
      "“[The Mothers] filed another affidavit [on] the first day of the hearing that showed all the different steps that they already took to try to voice their concerns,” Blouin said. “It was taken into account with the final report of the [Office de consultation publique de Montréal].”\n",
      "On the second day of the hearing, the Court established that it had the responsibility to act in an honourable way toward Indigenous peoples as stipulated by the honour of the Crown constitutional principle. The principle outlines that the government must “act with honour, integrity, good faith, and fairness in all of its dealings with Indigenous peoples.” \n",
      "In anticipation of the hearings, Divest McGill, a student-run environmental justice group, held events to mobilize the McGill community in support of the Mothers. One of the events was a protest outside of the Palais de justice de Montréal on Oct. 26. About 30 people attended, with some individuals inside the courthouse watching the hearing, while others watched the live stream from outside. Maya Garfinkel, U4 Arts and Divest organizer, believes that students must bear witness to McGill’s litigation in order to hold the administration accountable for its actions. \n",
      "“McGill’s strategy, as with many issues that McGill faces, has been to sweep things under the rug. So in order to combat that strategy of erasure, we need to do the opposite,” Garfinkel said in an interview with the Tribune. “We need to raise awareness and bring people into the fold who may not be aware of what is happening otherwise.” \n",
      "On Oct. 25, Divest held a movie screening in support of the Mothers, showcasing Kanehsatake, 270 Years of Resistance, a film about the Oka Crisis, or the Kanesatake Resistance—a confrontation between members of the Mohawk Nation and the city of Oka, which called in the Canadian army after trying to expand a golf course into a Mohawk burial ground.\n",
      "“It is ultimately a story of resilience, and we want to take that message of resilience forward as we continue to act in solidarity with the Mohawk Mothers and the Indigenous peoples in resistance across Turtle Island,” Garfinkel said.  \n",
      "Edna Isabel Mameanskum, a protestor and member of the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach, was present for the hearing, and condemned McGill’s alleged desecration of graves. She believes that the Canadian legal system is not built for handling issues regarding unmarked Indigenous graves, as there is no previous jurisprudence entailing how to deal with mass burial sites on unceded land. \n",
      "“I felt obligated to be here because everyone needs a proper burial. Why would you just go and move the bodies of children, especially children,” Mameanskum said in an interview with the Tribune. “I was inside and […] lawyers said they’re not qualified to make these kinds of decisions because their laws are white laws. He said we’re here because of colonialism. It really hit me [….] I felt chills.” \n",
      "Following his decision to grant an emergency injunction, Justice Moore commended Mohawk traditions of mediation. He encouraged both parties to uphold those principles instead of adversarial litigation. \n",
      "“He said that these talks should be inspired perhaps by the way discussions happen in the Longhouse and Mohawk tradition,” Blouin said. “The Mohawk Mothers are not opposing McGill per se. They respect their educational vocation, but […] this is a question of the land there. If McGill is standing on unceded land, it has to be dealt with in a respectful manner.” \n",
      "Kahentinetha emphasized that the long-standing Indigenous decision-making process should be of interest to all parties. She recounted a time when she taught members of the McGill community about the approach and the importance of constructive debating. \n",
      "“When we taught it the first time at McGill, we were there for a whole day,” Kahentinetha said. “We explained it to them, and gave them a problem to work on. They loved it. They said ‘this is the best decision-making system I’ve ever seen.’ This is not adversarial. This is one where people learn to understand each other. And in the end, people can become friends.”  \n",
      "The Mothers celebrated their win, but quickly returned to preparing for the collective discussions in four months. In the next hearing, which has yet to be scheduled, all parties will collectively determine the most effective and ethical archeological practice for performing work in a way that is respectful to the land and the potential remains.\n",
      "“We have four months to work out some kind of agreement on each side, so that we understand each other, what we’re trying to do, and just how this is going to be carried out,” Kahentinetha said. “We really want to start a good dialogue. That’s what we’re working towards, a peaceful dialogue with McGill.” \n",
      "McGill is also preparing for the collaborative discussions. McGill media relations officer Frédérique Mazerolle outlined McGill’s next steps after the court-ordered excavation postponement in an email to the Tribune. \n",
      "“The archaeological fieldwork […] is completed and the intervention did not lead to any archaeological discovery,” Mazerolle wrote. “Following the court decision this week, granting a short-term injunction to the defendants, McGill will examine the decision thoroughly over the coming weeks and will reach out to the special interlocutor to discuss ways of meeting the concerns that were raised.” \n",
      "The Mothers urge students to continue to peacefully support their case. In fact, student activism may have made a difference in the Mothers’ case, according to Garfinkel. \n",
      "“I was struck by the mentions of student activism and student voices even in the courtroom,” Garfinkel said. “For example, the Mohawk Mothers were able to leverage the fact that many students had spoken out against the issue during their statement in court, making it clear that […] there are many in McGill’s public, including in the student body, who oppose the way the project has been moving forward. It was clear that this statement had weight in the courtroom and we were proud to have contributed to that possibility.” \n",
      "The Mothers hope that their win will mark a new era of reconciliation at McGill.\n",
      "“Real progress can be made from here. It’s wonderful that we’re going to do this,” Kahentinetha said. “No more stress, no more fear, none of that. Can you imagine that after [500 years], we’re now going to be taken seriously?” }, {'metadata': {'title': 'archeological-work-at-the-new-vic-site-dominates-mcgill-senate-meeting', 'author': 'Lily_Cason', 'publisher': 'the tribune', 'URL': 'https://www.thetribune.ca/news/archeological-work-at-the-new-vic-site-dominates-mcgill-senate-meeting25102022/', 'summary': 'During the university’s second Senate meeting of the academic year on Oct. 19, senators discussed the Kanien’kehá:ka Kahnistensera’s (Mohawk Mothers) legal dispute with McGill over the New Vic Project and the university’s COVID-19 protocols.', 'tags': ['news', 'student']}, 'text': \n",

      "Senator David Vaillancourt questioned why McGill’s archeological approach deviates from the Canadian Archeological Association’s (CAA) framework for investigating sites of potential unmarked graves, a concern the Kahnistensera have also raised. Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Fabrice Labeau responded, justifying the archeological approach by claiming that the area under investigation may have Indigenous artifacts from pre-colonial times, but almost certainly does not have unmarked graves. \n",
      "“We are really looking at a place that is in front of the Hersey Pavilion, that is very far away from the Allen Memorial Hospital,” Labeau said. “The likelihood of unmarked graves in that area is very, very low [….] We also want to mention that the way the archeological search will be carried out later in other areas is not predetermined.”\n",
      "Dicki Chhoyang, McGill’s Director of Stakeholder Relations, stressed that Quebec, not McGill, is responsible for the site and that McGill’s efforts to investigate the Mohawk Mothers’ claims are simply out of care for the Indigenous community.(The Mothers have repeatedly stated that their treatment from McGill has been hostile.)\n",
      "“We spoke to the elected council of Kahnawake, communicated with Kanesatake, Akwesasne, Hurons-Wendat, Anishinabeg, the Assembly of First Nations,” Chhoyang said. “Then we reached out to all the elders, we explained to them, ‘we’re not officially responsible, but our community is very concerned, so in due diligence as a responsibility to them, we are reaching out to you. How would you like us to handle this?’”\n",
      "Senator Margaret Levey countered Labeau and Chhoyang by pointing out the benefits for the university of complying with the CAA’s guidelines and collaborating with the Kahnistensera.\n",
      "“Isn’t the advantage clear that it would be good publicity, that it would be a good step toward reconciliation?” Levey said.\n",
      "Senators then briefly discussed COVID-19 policies. Senator Miranda Hickman expressed a desire for greater information and guidance from the university surrounding the pandemic, particularly in light of the dissolution of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on COVID Academic Planning and Policies. \n",
      "“It is often hard to keep tabs on what’s happening around COVID-related issues […] and especially hard to tune into collective wisdom and best practices, as we all have to make ad hoc decisions in response to what is happening,” Hickman said. \n",
      "Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies) Angela Campbell responded that the committee on COVID-19-related issues was always meant to be temporary and that no revival of the committee is being considered at this time.\n",
      "Campbell later presented the new Regulations on Academic Staff Grievances and Disciplinary Procedures, which she had outlined at the Sept. 21 Senate meeting. The Senate approved these regulations.\n",
      "Moment of the meeting: During his opening remarks, Manfredi affirmed the University’s commitment to working with the re-elected Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government, and specifically the Minister of Education, to advance joint goals.\n",
      "Soundbite: “McGill here has an opportunity to model a form of collaboration and peacemaking in the process of developing the New Vic [….] It seems collaborating with the Mothers would be far less expensive, time-consuming than a court case, and it’s difficult to understand why McGill is so certain that no remains will be found, why they would not choose to hear the Mothers.” }, {'metadata': {'title': 'Petition to Investigate Unmarked Graves at McGill University', 'author': 'Mohawk Mothers', 'publisher': 'Change.org', 'URL': 'https://www.change.org/p/mcgill-university-investigate-unmarked-graves-at-mcgill-university', 'summary': 'This is a petition initiated by Ellen Atkin under the auspices of the Mohawk Mothers to investigate unmarked graves at McGill University.', 'tags': ['indigenous']}, 'text': \n",

It is the location of the Iroquoian village that Jacques Cartier, the first French explorer of the region, witnessed in 1525, and sheltered an estimated 3000 inhabitants in 50 to 70 longhouses. A crucial location from which all the surrounding waterways can be observed, Tekanontak was used to send smoke signals that were picked up in the Adirondaks before making their way down the East Coast, according to Indigenous oral history. It was and remains one the largest burial sites in North America. \n",

      "Built in 1863 to serve as a villa for Sir Hugh Allan, a shipping magnate and wealthy railway promoter, the Institute was absorbed into the Royal Victoria Hospital by 1940 and became a psychiatric ward in 1944.

McGill refuses to follow the guidelines developed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and by archaeologists engaged in searching for unmarked graves since the first findings in Tk’emlúps in 2021. As stated by these, “any work to locate missing Indigenous children must be led by Indigenous communities.” The upcoming intervention at the Royal Victoria Hospital is not led by Indigenous people, but rather by development promoters and a private firm they hired. \n",
      "Since then, a temporary occupation by settler anarchists took place, the offices of Arkéos were vandalized by people claiming to act on behalf of the Mohawk Mothers (the action was condemned by the Mohawk Mothers and the solidarity committee), and a vigil by Divest McGill was held, surrounded by more police then there were citizens. Tensions are high in an extremely important case for Indigenous sovereignty on the island of Tiohtià:ke. The court hearing will be held on October 26, 2022, at the Montréal court. In order to better understand the situation, let us look back at the situation and how the tensions on Tiohtià:ke have built up since the Pope’s visit in July. \n",
      "Across territories of Indigenous Peoples in so-called Canada, the backlash of trauma was and continues to be felt by the express papal visit of July 24-29, 2022. Pope Francis' official apology was framed as an apology for the behavior of religious affiliates in residential schools without recognizing the church’s institutional role in cahoots with the federal government, which acted in a systematic manner, to undermine Indigenous ways of being. This common institutional strategy of blaming individual actors rather than taking responsibility for the core ideologies still salient in the church, and so many other institutions, only adds smoke to the smoke screens of an already aggravated political context of centuries of broken promises in a lingering colonial apparatus.  \n",
      "Despite the recognition of a \"cultural genocide\" by the Canadian authorities following the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Church still refuses to take responsibility for the consequences of the Catholic institution's genocidal mission in the public policies of Canadian federal state and provincial states colonial endeavors up to the 1990s, whose consequences are still very present. Faced with symbolic apologies and inaction, the reactions are mixed and many criticize the absence of responsibility or a work plan to “make things right”, as reported throughout the visit by APTN News.\n",
      "In Tiohtià:ke (Montréal), the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) held a press conference two days after the pope’s apology in Edmonton, at the foot of Tekanontak, under the continued smear of the Saint Jean Baptiste society’s cross overlooking the city of Montréal. This collective of Indigenous women from Kahnawa:ke – a Mohawk reserve on the south shore of Montréal – have been fighting for the recognition of unceded territories on and around the island of Tiohtià:ke for decades. They expressed their disbelief and feeling of emptiness following this apology. If the church and Pope Francis are “serious about making things right, [they] should start by revoking the Doctrine of Discovery”, said Kwetiio, spokesperson for the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera. \n",
      "Their demands were clear: there is a need for these institutions to recognize their ongoing ideological tenets and to take action to reverse the settlers' imposition of a colonial ecology. On the island of Tiohtià:ke, this means symbolically, taking down the cross which continually “remind us of the horrors that we have lived and that we have survived”, says Kahentinetha. It also means, on a structural level, questioning the current dismissal and appropriation of the island by private corporations like McGill University and its project to transform the former Royal Victoria Hospital into a New Vic modernized facility for “sustainable development and public policy research” with 50 000 square meters right on the south flank of mount Tekanontak. It is for this reason that the Kahnistensera have recently gone to court “in a bid to block the start of excavation work”(For more information, see the release of the affidavits by the Kahnistensera, here). \n",
      "The case of a city like Montréal based on the island of Tiohtià:ke is particularly relevant. The settlement of French colonizers on the island created the Eurocentric narrative of a transient Indigenous presence on the land, despite clear mapping and testimony of interactions over the centuries. It is understandable then that a cross raised high-up on the mount that once overlooked the multiple archeological sites of Indigenous villages continues to upset the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera that ask for its removal as survivors of residential schools. \n",
      "When one starts digging, the veneer always scratches off from the surface with ease to reveal the underlying structure. The narrative of an abandoned island, and a cross that only testifies of settler perseverance and not colonial imposition of christianity, is yet again a direct attempt to forget the complex history of permanent presence, negotiations, warfare, and partial destruction of Indigenous Peoples.\n",
      "If one initiates a forensic study of the archeology and architectural development of Montréal as a city on the island of Tiohtià:ke, one finds a completely different story. Affirming the absence of Indigenous people or Mohawk lineage on the island of Tiohtià:ke, is (i) a direct refusal to acknowledge the worldview and oral knowledge of the Mohawk people and the history of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy, and (ii) a willful ignorance of the complexity of continued warfare, epidemics and movements of Indigenous populations occurring during the centuries of colonization in the midst of which Chomedey de Maisonneuve founded the city of Montréal.\n",
      "The Rotinonshón:ni’s cosmology refutes ownership of land as they consider that “we belong to the earth” in the same way as “we belong to our mother.” “The feminine principle having, in matrilinear Peoples, an intrinsic link to land”. This definition of humans as linked and belonging to the earth also breaks the ethnic lineage to one of specific characteristics of a land and of a way of living on it, i.e., the logics through which we inhabit a given land (the definition of ecology – eko (habitat), logos (logic)). The very nature of lineage is therefore completely different as it is based on an ethical belonging that is transcribed both in the characteristics of a land but also in the animal’s spirit to which one belongs in a clan. This explains in great part the fragmented and extremely mobile networks that constitute Indigenous Peoples’ way of life on Turtle Island and their mixing beyond “national” belonging that revokes the modern conception of communitarian enclosure associated with birth (Natio) blood rights on a given territory.\n",
      "In ignoring this oral history, the compressed Mohawk’s claim now needs to justify its political and legal arguments under the requirements of the settler’s ecology. Such refusal to recognize the other’s ecology documents the history of Montréal and Québec’s modern foundations. For many decades, Québec nationalism considered itself a victim of the British colonizers, and ever since built its relation to the land and Indigenous people through the invisibilisation of their struggle: the Indigenous were the federal government’s affair and not the real victims of colonization, as the Québecois considered themselves a minority overwhelmed and conquered by the Anglo-Saxon majority.\n",
      "The separatist and nationalist movement was confronted to this contradiction when it took the path, following decades of fragmentary resistance through the Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ), of “converting their separatism into sovereignism” in the wake of the 1970s economic crisis. Abandoning the fragmented minority of its initial separatist struggle, the Québec nationalism grew into a majoritarian ambition of achieving “logistico-institutional” independence by “conquering the forces of nature.” These numerous development projects were instrumental in the blackmailing and invisibilisation of Indigenous communities and their ways of life.\n",
      "Finally, observing the developmental blackmailing in the upsurge of Québec’s national industrialization can help us to better understand Montréal’s modernization process. The documentary Main basse sur la ville reveals how during the 1970s, Montréal’s historical neighborhoods were destroyed with just as little care or consideration as for original archeological testimonies of Indigenous presence. Through the accumulated wealth stolen from the colonized African countries, Montréal’s skyscrapers were being built by the same European financiers and State funded colonial corporations that were ravaging the world economically and ecologically.\n",
      "The development of Montréal in the 1970s was never intended to ameliorate the lives of the citizens of settler societies, let alone that of Indigenous Peoples parked in reserves nearby. The constant speculation on land to perpetuate the expansion of an unlivable way of life is still a financial game in the hands of a few families in Montréal. A concrete prison continues to be raised, drowning the history of the island.\n",
      "The New Vic Project is a perfect representation of a refusal from the public and private institutional powers to re-think the model on which they stand in the settler metropolis of Montréal. The institution of McGill, founded by a fur trader turned land speculator and slave owner, Montréal’s richest citizen, holds an endowment of $1,892 billion (as of April 30, 2021), and its wealthy industrial donors and fossil fuel-friendly board members continue to finance an economy that keeps refusing any space for Indigenous ecologies and perpetuates the extractivist denial of settler societies.\n",
      "The validation of the New Vic project as part of the Québec government’s $787 million financing for renovation of post-secondary educational institutions, stands firm in the tradition of developmental blackmail. Despite claiming in the seven directing principles of the project that it will “recognize the Indigenous past [and not the present] of the New Vic location and honor it” (as a fifth principle), the project reasserts the hegemony of the settler ecology on the land of Indigenous Peoples by claiming as a first and foremost principle that it is a project “for Montréal, Québec and Canada”, not the Indigenous. Its research program focuses on building a “unique expertise in science and engineering for sustainable development with the humanities and public policy making, to turn knowledge into action.”\n",
      "Not once does it give way to actual Indigenous knowledge or ways of life, to considering their seminal and historical importance in the preservation of a liveable and sustainable environment on the island of Tiohtià:ke, Kanien’kehá:ka land and so-called Canada. The full hypocrisy of the veneer of reconciliation is at work in every page of the New Vic project and its public announcements. From superficial acknowledgment statements, to promises of “respectful relations to Indigenous Peoples” and embedding “Indigenous themes'' in the project, the message is clear: Indigenous presence is a past motif that only merits to adorn the walls of a brand new development project as memories of a bygone era. In this way, we move from firsting to lasting.\n",
      "If the New Vic project truly aimed at tackling “the biggest issues of our time by thinking outside the box” in the words of principal and vice-chancellor Suzanne Fortier, then let us propose a series of concrete Indigenous knowledge that turns directly into action. We need solutions that can fulfill the publicly acknowledged need for serious reconciliation and reparation of our Peoples. \n",
      "Building on the Indigenous ecology we have described along the way, we can imagine how reparations can truly be enacted in this particular context. As settler societies only begin to accept the persistent existence of the “other” – those ungovernable and fragmented Peoples that do not own this land but are a part of it – a shift needs to occur to allow for a middle ground to exist. If settlers – once migrants, before clouding their minds with illusions of discovery, ownership, and destiny upon this land – accept to listen and give living space to other ecologies, then perhaps the successive betrayals of the past treaties can be overcome and the twofold-cheater attitude rejected and condemned.\n",
      "To do so one must first cease to systematically force the “other” into one’s own intellectual framework. This can only be accomplished if we are willing to make things right by returning lands and listening to legitimate calls from Indigenous Peoples to return great parts of the territory we claim to own, back to their traditional ways. \n",
      "Returning back to traditional ways means to reinstate a value system that measures the wealth of a given community according to the health of its habitat, and the success of its members by the solidity of the relations nurtured within the community and living beings of our environment. The words of Tekarontakeh a kanien’kehá:ka Elder during the book launch of the Mohawk Warrior Society: A Handbook on Sovereignty and Survival strengthens this statement, and what is at the heart of reclaiming Indigenous ways of life: \n",
      "“We did not make citizens of anyone, we made you equals and this is what should be taking place around the world. It should not be, small groups of people to decide. This is why we have been fighting, we know about that way of life, we know about these teachings, we continue to adhere to it in the best way we can, but we are constantly being oppressed, we are constantly having this genocide committed.\"\n",
      "What is being asked here, is to reclaim, that is “to reappropriate or rehabilitate something that has been partially lost, or denied so as to be modified by this new learning.” At the heart of Tiohtià:ke this can be accomplished if we listen to the demands of the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera. As clan mothers, they hold through the Woman nomination belt (Ka’shastnsera Kontihwe Ne Iotiian:shon) a responsibility on unceded territory that forms a legitimate legal and political claim on Tiohtià:ke.\n",
      "Hence, in solidarity with the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera and following some of their long-running demands, we offer as a committee a series of short and long-term proposals to overcome the settler’s ecology embedded in the New Vic project and to call for action to implement a project that truly responds to the need of making things right. This can only be a first step towards actions and means to reinstate a way of life embedded in the kanien’kehá:ka land on which Montréal currently resides. \n",
      "If we are to act according to our words and respect the original agreements on which Indigenous Peoples, specifically of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy in the case of Tiohtià:ke, welcomed us on Anowarà:ke (Turtle island), then we must first and foremost consider how to rehabilitate the Tehiohate (Two Row Wampum), the Rotinonshón:ni protocol and alliance belt for relationships with settlers. \n",
      "This agreement, first made with the Dutch settlers, then the English and French, helps understand the agreement under which migrants have been welcomed onto this land: as ships on a river we are to move and live side by side as communities to “remain parallel” and refrain from crossing on the other’s way of life. As Philippe Blouin explains: “This paradoxical conception of alliance through separation not only applies to relationships with settlers, but between any and all social groups, including non-human nations, ensuring their mutual respect in diplomacy.”\n",
      "On the island of Tiohtià:ke and its surroundings, this would signify a way of renegotiating land on a colonized space to give back parts of the island to an Indigenous presence that could form a networked ecology of non-sedentary paths from Kahnawa:ke to Tekanontak, to Kahneseta:ke and beyond. Such a renegotiation would reinstate the row of Indigenous land and the eastern gate of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy. \n",
      "Removing the cross from Tekanontak, returning the mount to kanien’kehá:ka care, and enacting land heritage out of the dispossessions made by theft would be a first step. The next would be to conceive of new legal, economic, and social checks and balances for a two row development of ways of life on the territory, from Montréal to Québec, to Canada giving way to a two-sided land with equal territories for Tiohtià:ke, Rotinonshón:ni and Indigenous Peoples in general.\n",
      "To do this, however, we must begin locally by researching how one may reconsider urbanity, institutions, and territory beyond the sole imposition of a settler’s ecology.\n",
      "The most urgent local demands arise from the twofold cheater’s trap of a project like the New Vic. If McGill truly wished to implicate and acknowledge Indigenous land then they would follow consequential proposals such as these: \n",
      "A first short term response would be to help conduct a full external enquiry on the grounds of the Allan Memorial Institute and the Royal Victoria Hospital. This investigation using forensic tools such as those proposed by Forensic Architecture, would study the allegations of unmarked graves and of multiple archeological sites presumed to be there by the Arkeos report. \n",
      "A second short-term response would be to establish, under the initiative of the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera, a longhouse location to serve as an archival and cultural center in the tradition of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy. If the cross is removed, mount Tekanontak could become a key part of the process of making things right here on the island of Tiohtià:ke. \n",
      "On a more long-term approach, if McGill were to accept a real external enquiry and give the land back to a “public domain” entrusted to kanien’kehá:ka people in order to set up an architectural project based on the guidance of archeological research established during the public consultation, McGill would finally “anchor” its project into the collectivity whilst reconciling with the Indigenous people that it systematically ignores when it states that it wishes to interact with the collectivity of “neighbors, Montréalers, Québécois, and Canadians”, failing once again to identify the presence of kanien’kehá:ka Peoples, despite acknowledging it was their land a few pages earlier.\n",
      "The reality is that private institutions like McGill as much as public ones like the city of Montréal, still do not wish to consider their role to make things right as one of actual actions in reparation. Real long-term solutions, like giving research funds and land, currently owned and managed by McGill to kanien’kehá:ka people to transform the worded desires of “acknowledgment and reconciliation” into concrete actions, keeps on never occurring. The hypocrisy of the extractivist denial is more salient than ever in the attitudes and proposals of the New Vic project and the way McGill as much as the public institutions have handled it.\n",
      " On this island of passage, where Indigenous nomads, migrant workers, and wandering souls have resided, and where in the past, smoke signals regularly informed the surrounding Rotinonshón:ni territories with news from the eastern gate, a signal was sent to all the Peoples of Anowarà:ke (Turtle Island). To remind those who woefully forget, that the irresolution of unceded lands on the island of Tiohtià:ke and its surroundings cannot be ignored. Action to restore ways of life that coincide once more with the earth and the two row wampum to which us settlers gave our word only to betray it, must take place once more to find a way out of a society that has passed the point of no return in climate doom and ecological collapse.  }, {'metadata': {'title': 'kahentinethas-challenge-to-mcgills-new-vic-project', 'author': 'benjamin wexler', 'publisher': 'the tribune', 'URL': 'https://www.thetribune.ca/news/kahentinethas-challenge-to-mcgills-new-vic-project02112021/', 'summary': None, 'tags': ['news', 'student']}, 'text': \n",
      "Kahentinetha, a Kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk Mother) of the Bear Clan and founder of Mohawk Nation News, is demanding the suspension of McGill’s New Vic project. In a brief posted to the Mohawk Nation News website, Kahentinetha called on McGill to acknowledge Indigenous sovereignty and to allow an investigation team—comprised of a surveyor, geologist, search dog, all guided by GeoView Pro software—to search for unmarked graves she suspects may be on the project site.\n",
      "In the Mohawk Nation News post, Kahentinetha argued that because the Royal Victoria Hospital site sits on unceded Kanien’kehá:ka territory, the kaia’nere:kowa (The Great Law of Peace), pre-colonial Mohawk law,  applies. Under this law, the Kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera are caretakers of the land, and all decisions regarding it must be made with their consent. Additionally, Kahentinetha claimed that the Canadian government held money from the Iroquois Trust Fund, loaned it to McGill Universityin 1847, and never paid it back. \n",
      "According to a McGill media relations officer Frédérique Mazerolle, McGill’s Indigenous Initiatives Unit and the Indigenous-owned consulting firm Acosys aimed to include Indigenous peoples in producing the project’s design.\n",

      "In an interview with the Tribune, Kahentinetha argued that the land should be treated as an archeological site until further investigations are completed.\n",
      "“[Rumours of unmarked graves on the property] are becoming more and more serious, so we would like that investigated,” Kahentinetha said. “And certainly there are our people buried up there in pre-colonial times, and we want that investigated as well. Nothing can proceed until that is done [….] If there’s going to be any investigation, we want to be involved with that. We want it done to our satisfaction.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha believes McGill’s exchanges with Indigenous peoples should go beyond discussions with select community representatives, and should instead look to gain the consent of each member of the community, according to structures of Indigenous law.\n",
      "“I do not think any one of [the Indigenous groups and representatives consulted] lives by the Great Peace,” Kahentinetha said. “We do not want consultation. You have to get our permission, and our permission we get from the Great Law [….] Each one of us has to have a say in whatever the decision is. Each one of us. Nobody speaks for us.”\n",
      "In the 1950s and 60s, Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron experimented with torture techniques at the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital next to the old Royal Victoria building. One Mohawk Nation News article features an interview with Lana Ponting, a survivor of these experiments, who says, “I am convinced that there are bodies buried in the property in the interview [….] I was really concerned about Indigenous peoples. I firmly believe that some of them were in the Allan.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha, too, wants to send a forensic and archeological team to search for the bodies of potential Indigenous and non-Indigenous victims of Cameron’s experiments.\n",
      "Public consultation on the New Vic project is ongoing. The rotisken’raketeh (Men’s Council Fire) will present Kahentinetha’s brief to the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) on Nov. 10.\n",
      "Mazerolle did not specify whether McGill would change the direction of the project to investigate human remains, pointing to prior studies conducted onsite.\n",
      "“McGill commissioned a study on the archeological potential of the Royal Victoria Hospital site in 2016,” Mazerolle wrote. “According to this study, it is unlikely that Indigenous remains will be found on the New Vic Project site. However, McGill remains committed to collaborating with the government and First Nations communities regarding potential vestiges. Should such vestiges be found, it will be made public immediately, the work will be suspended, and an archaeological officer of the Minister of Culture and Communications will be alerted (as stated in the Cultural Heritage Act.1).”\n",
      "While the study Mazerolle references determined that pre-colonial Indigenous settlement on the project site was unlikely, it also states there is no way to confidently know whether it was a burial site, unless human remains are found.\n",

      "When a petition circulated to remove a statue of John A. Macdonald, Canada’s first prime minister who was responsible for the forced removal of Indigenous people from their lands, Keyes launched a counter petition, which was advertised on the foundation’s Facebook group. The petition, which shows publicly was started by Keyes, is still live. \n",
      "“I studied John A. Macdonald for 50 years, so I have a pretty good handle on who he was and what he did in his 50 years of political contributions to the country. I mean, when it comes to the First Nations, there’s definitely problems, but I think that might be cherry picking his entire legacy, which is quite broad,” Keyes said in an interview with THE EASTERN DOOR. \n",
      "“I think he may be slightly misunderstood by the public. You’re talking about a specific situation, but I don’t think that overcomes his entire 50 years of building the country and building the foundation.”\n",
      "Keyes said he did not post the petition in the foundation’s Facebook group. He called accusations by King of sentiments of racism by the petition’s signatories “a disgusting accusation.”\n",
      "“I’m certainly not a racist by any shape or form. It’s ridiculous. It’s a silly and ridiculous accusation that bears no resemblance to reality,” he said. \n",
      "Comments on the petition include direct references to Macdonald’s treatment of Indigenous people.\n",
      "“One of Sir John’s perceived crimes was educating the aboriginals (sic). At the time they lived in small communities outside of the main hub… The natives were having a difficult time communicating with the Europeans and the number was growing. How was he to dictate them and not continue the isolation? I would like someone to come up with a better solution,” one comment read.\n",
      "When asked if he would support the Mothers’ request for a leadership review, Keyes said he was unsure what their position was on the matter and that there had already been a blessing at the rock with a Catholic bishop, an Anglican bishop, a rabbi, and faithkeeper Ka’nahsohon Kevin Deer.\n",
      "“Kevin Deer blessed the site in the Mohawk language as well as the other participants,” he said. “There was never the slightest controversy concerning this excavation.”\n",
      "King maintains that Keyes’ role in the foundation is at odds with the ongoing project of reconciliation.\n",
      "“It’s weird because some people in the community who are Irish diasporans kind of gloss over the colonialism because now they’re beneficiaries of it,” King said. “Now they’re saying, ‘Oh, Canada’s the best country in the world,’ but they don’t understand that it only is for them, and it’s at the expense of Indigenous people. It’s a historical ignorance.”\n",
      "For the Mothers, this kind of sentiment in leadership of a site that could contain Indigenous graves is concerning. They are supporting King in demanding a leadership review to identify what players in the foundation’s leadership may be standing in the way of protecting Indigenous and Irish graves.\n",
      "“It irked me that someone who was a person on the board was using the platform to promote (keeping the John A. Macdonald statue), because it’s contrary to our people, and it’s racist,” Kwetiio said. “Everything else I expected, but I didn’t expect the person who’s (involved in) the foundation to want that.”\n",
      "The Mothers fear that without a leadership review, the site will be threatened with desecration by the construction of the REM train and other corporate projects. As caretakers of the land, they said the projects cannot go ahead without their consent.\n",
      "“It’s a big no-no to be profiting off someone’s burial ground, and it also shouldn’t be destroyed in the first place,” Kwetiio said. \n",

      "The Mohawk Mothers, also known as the Kahnistensera, will hold a press conference at the corner of avenue des Pins and Doctor Penfield on September 12, 2023, at 2:30pm.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera filed an Emergency Motion to halt drilling and excavation at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, which will be heard on Thursday September 14 at the Superior Court in Montreal. The Emergency Motion details breaches to the Settlement Agreement by McGIll and the SQI that the Mohawk Mothers repeatedly raised in direct talks about significant concerns with the way they are handling the archaeological investigation ordered by the Quebec Superior Court to search for unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera are shocked and disappointed that McGill University and the Société Québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) have pressed ahead with construction on September 11, 2023 by drilling a large number of holes marking the beginning of a series of excavations.\n",
      "The same day, McGill University issued a message to all its staff and students, declaring that the investigation of the zone where they want to start work is complete, and produced no evidence of graves. The Mohawk Mothers see these developments as major provocations, as the investigation is far from complete and McGill’s messaging predominantly emphasizes favourable findings while concurrently concealing or downplaying several discoveries that confirm the possibility of unmarked burials at the New Vic site. These discoveries require further follow-up to determine whether the New Vic development work can safely proceed.\n",
      "On August 29, 2023, the Mohawk Mothers filed a motion for a safeguard order to enforce the settlement agreement signed by all parties in April 2023, after a landmark injunction stopping work in October 2023. The Kahnistensera flagged several breaches to the letter and the spirit of the settlement agreement, after McGill and SQI disbanded the panel of three archaeologist experts agreed upon by all parties to make recommendations.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera’s court files show that McGill and the SQI refused to follow several recommendations from the archaeologists, such as sifting the soil of areas where anomalies of potential bodies were located. Court documents also reveal that the SQI refused to share data from Ground Penetrating Radar with the Canadian Archaeology Association and the panel of experts itself, and silenced numerous “unknown” anomalies that the GPR report say could possibly be graves of children or without coffins in public communications. Several artifacts, including a dress, children’s shoes and bones excavated in a zone where search dogs detected the scent of human remains have not yet been examined by experts, and the origin of the scent of human remains picked up by search dogs has not been established.\n",
      "According to the Kahnistensera, SQI and McGill have refused to allow the search dogs to return to the site to sniff the piles of soil that were excavated or determine whether the smell came from inside the building, where archaeologists were denied access. “Since the Panel was disbanded, McGill and SQI have basically decided to take over the whole investigation, even though they have been opposed to it even happening from the start,” said Kwetiio, a Mohawk Mother. “I don’t understand how it is even possible that they can act that way when a Court Order determined that this would be a Indigenous-led”, she said, “And there was just a little extra effort to do this the right way and provide closure to survivors and the families. We had gone such a long way with everything that happened.”\n",
      "During three weeks the work had stopped after the Mohawk Mothers and Cultural Monitors were attacked by security guards working for the SQI on July 25th. The guards had assaulted someone present to take his phone to erase a video, while someone else recorded racist insults telling the Mohawk elders to “go make some children” and “find a life.”\n",
      "According to Kahentinetha, “on September 11 we saw the two same security guards on the archaeological site, even though the SQI told us they had been removed”. Even though the settlement agreement allowed Indigenous cultural monitors to be on the site and monitor the work, Kahentinetha, 84 years old, says they now fear for their safety. “The security guards that attacked us are still there, and now they want to rush in large-scale excavation for their New Vic project. In fact they drilled those holes yesterday without us being present. They didn’t even give us a safety training for working in zones under construction with heavy machinery, and we don’t have the proper equipment. The settlement agreement said we have to be there, but it’s extremely dangerous in these conditions.” The Kahnistensera also indicated that violations of construction safety regulations were already flagged, as masonry material stacked higher than 1.8 meters next to an unsanitary toilet cultural monitors were expected to use. “Are we still being treated like animals, like a problem to get rid of, in the heart of Montreal, where the village of our ancestors sits,” said Kahentinetha. “But we will not take genocide anymore, both Canadian and Mohawk law agree on this,” she said.\n",
      "The Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) is a Kahnawake-based group that helps Indigenous women accomplish their traditional cultural duty as caretakers of the land, to protect all life, including their children and ancestors.

      "According to Kaianerehkó:wa, the Great Law of Peace, the Kahnistensera are the “Progenitors of the Nation. They shall own the land and the soil.” Women are thus caretakers of the land, it is our cultural duty to protect all life, including our children and ancestors. This was our position as Plaintiffs before the Superior Court of Quebec. \n",
      "As caretakers of the land, we see it as our inherent duty to ensure that allegations of undiscovered evidence and unmarked graves are considered with the respect, gravity and cultural sensitivity that they deserve. \n",
      "In June 2022, Kanien’kehá :ka lawyer, Kimberly Murray, was appointed the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools. The purpose of Murray’s position is to “work closely and collaboratively with Indigenous leaders, communities, Survivors, families and experts to identify needed measures and recommend a new federal legal framework to ensure the respectful and culturally appropriate treatment and protection of unmarked graves and burial sites of children at former residential schools.” \n",
      "Murray’s office is also tasked with highlighting the connections between Residential Schools and other institutions which may also contain unmarked graves, including sanatoriums, hospitals, and detention centers.  \n",

      "One of the oldest universities in Canada, McGill University is named after James McGill, a wealthy fur trader and slave owner whose statue was toppled by activists in 2021. McGill’s controversial  links with military research have scandalized the public on several occasions. The university’s psychiatric department became the central hub of the CIA’s unethical psychiatric experiments in the 1950 and 1960s. \n",
      "In 2018, the Government of Quebec authorized McGill University to prepare an Opportunity Study; it looked at repurposing part of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site. Since then, Quebec has mandated Pierre Major to lead the New Vic project and transform part of the Royal Victoria Hospital into a new campus. \n",
      "Promoter of New Vic project, the SQI was established by the Government of Quebec in 2013. Its mission is to support public bodies “in the management of their public infrastructure projects by ensuring rigorous planning, implementation and monitoring of projects.” In 2018, the SQI was mandated by the Government of Quebec to create a Master Plan for the repurposing of the Royal Victoria Hospital site. \n",
      "Know History has been contracted by the Mohawk Mothers to conduct archival research and statement gathering. This work will support the archaeological investigation into the presence of unmarked graves on the site of the New Vic Project. \n",

      "Under Quebec’s Cultural Heritage Act, the City of Montreal is responsible for preserving the Mount-Royal Patrimonial Site, and the Royal Victoria Hospital buildings. \n",
      "The aim of the Cultural Heritage Act is to “promote, in the public interest and from a sustainable development perspective, the knowledge, protection, enhancement and transmission of cultural heritage, which is a reflection of a society’s identity. It is also intended to promote the designation of deceased persons of historical importance and historic events and sites.” \n",
      "Mount Royal’s designation as a Historic and Natural District reflects a desire on behalf of government to preserve the many historical sites and monuments located in the historic territory. Mount Royal includes Mount Royal Park, religious sites and monuments, and burial sites for Indigenous and European-Quebecois populations. \n",
      "Band councils were imposed on Indigenous Peoples through the Indian Act. Following a Canadian political structure—including the election of band councils by band members—it is a governance model that is largely incompatible with indigenous political organizations and values. As stated in the Haudenosaunee Position Paper, presented to the United Nations in 197, Band Councils are “political colonies among Native peoples.” \n",
      "As traditional Longhouse Kanien'kehá:ka women, the Mohawk Mothers follow  the Kaianerehkó:wa, a precolonial constitution which is based on consensual decision-making and harmony between clans, genders, and peoples. According to the Kaianerehkó:wa, the Kahnistensera (women, life-givers) are the “progenitors of the soil.” We are in charge of selecting speakers for our people, and of caretaking the land and all children of the past, present and future generations. \n",
      "The Government of Canada, as with all levels of government, plays an important role in Canada’s journey towards reconciliation.  \n",
      "As one of the Calls to Action outlined in the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report, the commission called upon the federal government to “work with provincial, territorial, and municipal governments, churches, Aboriginal communities, former residential school students, and current landowners to develop and implement strategies and procedures for the ongoing identification, documentation, maintenance, commemoration, and protection of residential school cemeteries or other sites at which residential school children were buried. This is to include the provision of appropriate memorial ceremonies and commemorative markers to honour the deceased children.” As per Article 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, Canada respects the ancestral and treaty rights of Indigenous Peoples. Over the last decades, Canada has publicly repeated its commitment to efforts with Indigenous Peoples, and more recently, to applying the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations. Nevertheless, when called to Court by Indigenous peoples, including the Mohawk Mothers, Canada generally fights them. \n",
      "The Canadian Government has acknowledged that the residential school system amounted to a cultural genocide of Indigenous Peoples, for the systemic mistreatment of Indigenous peoples in institutions such as Residential Schools, hospitals, and detention centers. Indigenous peoples were exposed to a range of horrific abuse, all within systems aimed at killing “the Indian in the child.” \n",
      "The admission of genocide makes it necessary to examine Canada’s legal framework to ensure that future legislative changes will protect Indigenous peoples from crimes against humanity on their homeland. In accordance with Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people (UNDRIP), Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain their ancestral and treaty rights on their traditional territories. The Rotinonshonni (Iroquois) Confederacy has a longstanding treaty relationship with European settlers, reflected in the Tehiohate (Two Row Wampum), and the Silver Covenant Chain, which state that Indigenous and settler ways of life can live together on the condition that they do not encroach upon one another. According to its Constitution, Canada respects the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples on their territory, Anowarekeh (Turtle Island). }, {'metadata': {'title': 'Old Royal Victoria Hospital Project Remains', 'author': 'cbc news', 'publisher': 'cbc', 'URL': 'https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/old-royal-victoria-hospital-project-remains-1.6463685', 'summary': 'This article discusses the ongoing project at the old Royal Victoria Hospital and its current status.', 'tags': ['news', 'corporate']}, 'text': \n",

      "A report released Tuesday by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) outlined 31 recommendations for the $700-million project to transform part of the hospital into an academic centre.\n",
      "Overall, the OCPM is in favour of the plan, but its report takes into account concerns that the redevelopment could hinder efforts to find unmarked graves of Indigenous children on the old hospital's grounds.\n",
      "In March, a group of women called the Mohawk Mothers filed a civil suit in the Superior Court of Quebec demanding the suspension of the redevelopment plans for the former hospital pending an investigation into that possibility. Their claim will be heard in court next week. \n",
      "They believe the site may house archeological remains from the first pre-colonial Iroquois village.\n",
      "They also believe, based on testimony, that there may be Indigenous children buried near the Allan Memorial Institute following CIA-funded brainwashing experiments conducted by Dr. Ewan Cameron between 1954 and 1963.\n",

      "\"[Regarding] the possible presence of some ancient or more recent burials, for the commission it's very important that it's treated with the utmost respect and deference,\" said Isabelle Beaulieu, president of the OCPM.\n",
      "The report also urges McGill to relinquish the natural space and wooded area north of the hospital in order to integrate it within Mount Royal Park.\n",
      "Beaulieu says there's a \"very big attachment\" to the mountain and to the heritage of the Royal Vic site. \n",
      "That's why her report says the preservation of that heritage must be part of the project, which means maintaining heritage buildings and not adding new office towers that would hinder views to the mountain. \n",

      "On October 27, 2022, the Mohawk Mothers won an important battle: the first-ever injunction obtained by self-represented Indigenous peoples in a Canadian Court. Following their own Indigenous legal system, the Kaianerehkó:wa, the Mohawk Mothers reminded the Quebec Superior Court of their obligations vis-à-vis Indigenous peoples and called upon the Court to respect their own laws protecting Indigenous peoples from mistreatment, including extermination policies. In court, the Mohawk Mothers faced numerous adversaries, including top lawyers from McGill University, the Société Québécoise des Infrastructures (SQI), the McGill University Health Center (MUHC), the Royal Victoria Hospital, the City of Montreal, the Attorney General of Canada, and the Attorney General of Quebec.\n",
      "The injunction issued by Justice Gregory Moore was issued on the basis of the plaintiffs’ (Mohawk Mothers) concerns that Indigenous children were used as test subjects in medical experiments at the Royal Victoria Hospital, and were potentially buried on the site slated for redevelopment. These concerns were based on both archival evidence and witness accounts, including a first-hand account of Lana Ponting, 81, a survivor of the CIA-funded MKULTRA mind control experiments. The Mohawk Mothers argued that the land set for redevelopment was the site of the precolonial Iroquoian village of Tekanontak (Mount Royal) and was used as a burial site before the arrival of Europeans. The necessity of using appropriate archaeological means to preserve the history of Iroquoian peoples cannot be a topic of debate.\n",
      "Throughout the hearings on October 26th and 27th, defendants and promoters of the redevelopment project used an array of technical and legal arguments to convey the following:\n",
      "That the plaintiffs were using the wrong forum to lay their claims, as other administrative processes exist for such questions in the province of Québec;\n",
      "That the promoters have not broken any law(s) and are respecting the Quebec Heritage Act (the plaintiffs asked that the Act be declared unconstitutional because it considers Indigenous heritage as the property of Quebec);\n",
      "That most of the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, the Special Interlocutor, as well as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report, was not eligible for technical reasons; and\n",
      "That the six plaintiffs did not represent the Mohawk people –(the Mohawk Mothers argued that in Indigenous culture, every individual is free and self-representing)\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers emphasized that it was their cultural duty to act as caretakers of their traditional territory, and to protect the children of past, present, and future generations. We also argued that allowing excavation work on the site could cause irreparable harm to the identity, history, and trust of Indigenous peoples. We emphasized that the situation was urgent: shovels had already broken ground just two days before the hearings. \n",
      "The Court Ruling acknowledged that the balance of convenience favored the Mohawk Mothers, who would “suffer irreparable harm if the excavation work is not suspended for the time it takes to develop an appropriate archaeological plan to identify any unmarked graves,” following the best practices determined by the Canadian Archaeological Association. The ruling thus invited the parties to “speak out of court to settle their differences on an amicable basis.” The promoters were reminded of Call to Action number 76 (found in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report), which relates to missing children and burial information:\n",
      "The Indigenous community most affected shall lead the development of the investigation;\n",
      "Input must be sought from Survivors and Knowledge Keepers in developing those strategies;\n",
      "Indigenous protocols shall be respected before any invasive technical inspection and investigation of a cemetery site. \n",
      "The ruling also ordered the defendants to fund the investigation. \n",
      "Following the injunction that was obtained on October 27, 2022, the Mohawk Mothers participated in negotiations with McGill University and the SQI to develop an archaeological plan for the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital. A series of Judicial Settlement Conferences led all parties to adopt a settlement agreement which was homologated by the Quebec Superior Court and made public and enforceable on April 20, 2023.\n",
      "The agreement, signed by the Mohawk Mothers, McGill University, the McGill University Health Center, the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of Quebec, and the City of Montreal, provides that a panel of three archaeologists jointly selected by all parties will make recommendations for remote-sensing techniques that will ensure that no remains are destroyed or disturbed during excavation work. These techniques include Ground Penetrant Radar, search dogs, and LiDAR laser imaging. The panel’s recommendations will be binding to all parties. Cultural monitors, appointed by the Mohawk Mothers, will be present during the execution of the techniques to conduct appropriate ceremonies and to ensure that Indigenous protocols regarding burial sites are respected at all times. \n",
      "In addition, McGill University, the McGill University Health Center, and the Attorney General of Canada have committed to sharing archival materials under their custody that may be of assistance in locating unmarked graves, or which may provide information on the medical experiments that were conducted at the hospital. These materials will be gathered and studied by the historical research firm, Know History, with funding provided by Canada. A process for gathering the statements of survivors is also being initiated.\n",
      "A preliminary investigation, spearheaded by the Mohawk Mothers since 2021, has led to several findings currently being examined with the help of archivists and historians. In an affidavit sharing the results of the preliminary investigation, and supported by 141 exhibits, anthropologist Philippe Blouin outlined evidence supporting the claim that the Royal Victoria Hospital site may hide unmarked Indigenous graves.\n",
      "As the assimilation of Indigenous people was being carried out as part of the Residential School system Indigenous children were being sent to other disciplinary institutions as well, such as psychiatric wards, juvenile delinquency centers, correction homes, and reformatories. Through IQ tests, juvenile courts, Indian agents, as well as the health care system and military institutions, Indigenous and Inuit people were brought to the Royal Victoria Hospital where they were subjected to medical experiments.\n",
      "Currently, more than 130 Indigenous children have been reported missing after being treated in Quebec hospitals since the 1950s. There are likely many more: the names of many children were not recorded, as they had been taken from their families and deemed orphans. \n",

      "“It’s to be expected,” said Kwetiio, one of the Kahnistensera. “I don’t let those small things phase me.”\n",
      "As Kwetiio took to the stand, she outlined the importance of the case.\n",
      "“We are doing this for our people to know the truth, which is the first step towards reconciliation,” she said. “At stake is Indigenous Peoples’ trust in Canada and Quebec’s commitment to stop the genocide.”\n",

      "Special interlocutor Kimberly Murray noted that this is a historic case, and the first of its type to be heard in a Quebec Superior Court.\n",
      "“I was really concerned about the process, and about parties trying to discredit Indigenous people when they come forward with these allegations,” she said. “We know that their children were taken from Indian residential schools to other hospitals, and the Royal Victoria is one of those hospitals. The documents in the archives show that.”\n",
      "Murray also pointed to one of the affidavits shared in court, where survivor of Allan Institute experiments Lana Ponting recalled seeing guards with shovels. The Allan Institute houses the psychiatry department of the Royal Victoria Hospital, and was formerly used for psychiatric experiments such as MK-Ultra.\n",
      "Pointing remembered living with Indigenous victims, who were also subject to psychological experiments using hallucinogenic drugs, among others.\n",
      "“I found people standing over by the cement wall with shovels. There were rumours that there are bodies buried in Allan property,” the affidavit read. “And I believe some of them would be Indigenous people.”\n",

      "He noted that this means the likelihood of unmarked graves being found is incredibly small.\n",
      "“That to me doesn’t answer the question, because we know there are patterns,” explained Murray. “There’s been change to the land and the geography of the land, there’ve been changes of buildings and locations.”\n",
      "Murray also explained that current excavations could be out of line with best practices laid out by the Canadian Archaeological Association, which have been particularly important since the discoveries made in Kamloops. Murray noted that the redevelopment project here began before that discovery.\n",
      "When McGill’s lawyer Doug Mitchell took to the stand, he asked the court to trust the defence.\n",
      "“Trust the process,” he said. “Trust McGill.”\n",
      "The majority of the public in the gallery laughed at this request. Kwetiio found the appeal to give McGill a chance baffling.\n",
      "“We have given them several chances,” she said. “I think they’re behind on their chances. And we don’t rely on chances.”\n",
      "At one point, Mitchell gestured towards the Mohawk Mothers, saying, “I think it’s telling, judge, that there are only six plaintiffs here.”\n",
      "He went on to explain that since the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake (MCK) had not disputed the excavation and were not present in court to support the plaintiffs, the Mohawk Mothers’ demands were not reflective of the majority of the Mohawk people’s opinion. He suggested that the MCK’s absence at the case therefore meant that they opposed the Mohawk Mothers’ claims, essentially aligning the Council with the defence in court.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers took issue with this claim.\n",
      "“Each individual person that’s Onkwehón:we stands in their inherent right on their own,” Kwetiio said after the session.\n",
      "MCK has expressed wishes to remain neutral since the outset of the Mohawk Mothers’ project.\n",
      "“We didn’t want to be dragged into this,” said MCK chief Ross Montour. “This is not our project. We are not its proponent. McGill University is. SQI (Société québécoise des infrastructures) is. Nor are we the government of Quebec. Those parties need to defend their project, not the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake.”\n",
      "Montour explained that he has faced similar issues where media outlets have heavily coloured any statements about the case.\n",
      "“It shouldn’t be presented out there that we approved the project,” he added. “What’s really distressing about the whole thing is that we tried to stay out of this as much as possible.”\n",
      "The SQI criticized the “practical consequences” of an injunction preventing the continuation of archeological work on the site.\n",
      "“If an interlocutory injunction preventing renovation was granted every time any hospital was involved in any type of psychiatric experiment involving Indigenous Peoples, we would have a problem,” a lawyer for the SQI said in court.\n",
      "On the second day of the hearing, October 27, McGill’s lawyers reported that Arkéos had completed a brief archeological search the previous day, finding nothing of archeological significance and no bodies. However, the Mohawk Mothers did not believe that this invalidates the need for an injunction.\n",
      "Falconer continues to remind the defence of the lack of precedent in this case.\n",
      "“There is no law that says, ‘Here’s what one must do when past governments sought to hide the remains of children,’” he said. “I’ve never said this in court before, and I’m embarrassed I’m saying this, but we weren’t made for this. We’re failing.”\n",

      "All three dogs gave a signal when they came near the same stretch of wall near the Hersey Pavilion, which used to be the hospital's nurses residence. \n",

      "McGill University said Tuesday it will begin discussions with an Indigenous group that has raised concerns about unmarked graves after a court ruled that excavation work on a university expansion project would cause “irreparable harm.”\n",
      "Justice Gregory Moore last week ordered a halt to any excavation at the former site of the Royal Victoria Hospital until the parties hold discussions to develop an archeological plan to search for graves.\n",
      "“McGill University takes seriously the concerns of Indigenous communities regarding the New Vic project and seeks to better understand how they may be addressed,” Katherine Gombay, a McGill spokesperson, said in an email. She said the university will engage in a conversation with the Indigenous plaintiffs “with humility and in good faith.” The New Vic project is aimed at creating a new research and teaching hub.\n",
      "The judge also granted Kimberly R. Murray, the federally appointed independent special interlocutor for missing children and unmarked graves, intervener status in the case, and Murray told The Canadian Press Friday that she would take part in meetings with the parties.\n",
      "In his written decision released Tuesday, Moore said the identification of unmarked Indigenous graves is a priority for discovering the truth and working toward reconciliation. He cited the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s recommendations on residential school cemeteries and drew a link to the health-care system.\n",
      "“This call to action is drafted in terms of residential schools, but the plaintiff and the special interlocutor have demonstrated the possible parallels between that system and the health services offered to Indigenous peoples,” Moore wrote.\n",
      "The injunction was granted Thursday at the end of a two-day hearing, following a request in March from a group of elders from Kahnawake known as the Mohawk Mothers. The group has alleged that the bodies of Indigenous patients of the Allan Memorial Institute and the Royal Victoria Hospital are buried at the site scheduled to be redeveloped.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers claimed to have uncovered evidence of burials through interviews with a survivor of the MK-Ultra mind control experiments conducted in the 1950s and 1960s by Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allan Memorial Institute on the Royal Victoria grounds.\n",
      "During the hearing, lawyers representing McGill and the Societe quebecoise des infrastructures, a provincial body that supports public infrastructure projects, argued that there was no evidence of unmarked graves on the site. “Beyond what I consider to be the very firmly held convictions of the plaintiffs, there’s actually very little evidence to support their assertion that there would be graves on the site of the Royal Victoria Hospital,” McGill lawyer Doug Mitchell said.\n",
      "However, in his ruling, the judge referred to a 2016 archeological report prepared for McGill and the infrastructure corporation that suggested Mount Royal was used as a burial site before the arrival of Europeans. The former hospital is on the side of Mount Royal.\n",
      "Moore said the plaintiffs would “suffer irreparable harm if the excavation work is not suspended for the time it takes to develop an appropriate archeological plan to identify any unmarked graves.” He noted that there is no evidence the project would be delayed by the suspension since the construction timetable has not been established.\n",
      "The ruling concludes that there is urgency to respond to the plaintiffs’ “legitimate concerns” about unmarked graves. “Otherwise, the plaintiffs and those who share their concerns will continue to face the trauma that comes from not knowing whether, when, or how their community members’ graves might be disturbed,” the judge wrote.\n",
      "Julian Falconer, the lawyer representing Murray, called Moore’s ruling groundbreaking and said it was tremendously important for Indigenous Peoples that truth and reconciliation were at the heart of his decision.\n",
      "Murray’s affidavit provides the court with recommendations on best practices for undertaking a search for unmarked graves.\n",
      "“The judge has directed that deep dialogue occurs outside of the court, but also as part of the case management process. He also accepted that the information offered by the special interlocutor could be helpful,” Falconer said.}, {'metadata': {'title': 'Royal Victoria Hospital Plans Approval', 'author': 'Phil Carpenter', 'publisher': 'Global News', 'URL': 'https://globalnews.ca/news/8866520/royal-victoria-hospital-plans-approval/', 'summary': 'This article discusses the approval of the plans for the Royal Victoria Hospital.', 'tags': ['news', 'corporate']}, 'text': \n",
      "The former Royal Victoria Hospital site is one step closer to becoming a McGill University research facility, following hearings last September by the L’Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM)\n",
      "In its lengthy report, the office makes 31 recommendations addressing some of the concerns brought forward by various groups.\n",
      "“There’s a recommendation that we keep a lot of public spaces in this site,” said Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, saying that is very important for her.\n",
      "They also noted that the possible presence of Indigenous graves be “treated with deference.”\n",
      "A group called the Mohwak Mothers, however, who raised concerns about the possibility of graves of Indigenous children on the site, is not satisfied.\n",
      "“That project [should] be stopped and we need to have an investigation on those lands,” group member Kwetiio told Global News.\n",
      "The group believes the bodies may be linked to controversial psychological experiments conducted there in the ’50s and ’60s that received funding from the Canadian government and the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n",
      "Montreal mayor Valerie Plante agrees that any graves found on the site must be treated with respect.\n",
      "“We need to make sure,” she stressed.  “If there’s any doubts, if we think that there maybe potentially graves there, we need to do it right.”\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers say they feel insulted that the OCPM gave the the project the green light and that they and the community should be consulted more before any work is done.\n",
      "Last March, the group filed a motion in Quebec Superior Court to stop the work on the site.\n",
      "“We’re going to court next Monday to set the schedule for it and we will challenge everything,” Kahentinetha said.\n",
      "They said they vow to keep fighting.}, {'metadata': {'title': 'Mohawk Mothers Blazing a Trail', 'author': 'steve bonspiel', 'publisher': 'eastern door', 'URL': 'https://easterndoor.com/2022/11/07/mohawk-mothers-blazing-a-trail/', 'summary': 'This article highlights the efforts of Mohawk mothers in leading community initiatives and advocating for indigenous rights.', 'tags': ['news', 'indigenous']}, 'text': \n",
      "To challenge a giant head on is one thing. To do it representing yourselves in a foreign system, with no lawyers and nothing but a hunch, powerful protective instincts and bravery, is quite another.\n",
      "But that’s what the Kahnistensera Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk Mothers) group has done, forcing the McGill University dig at the former Royal Victoria Hospital to stop after a judge ruled more time was needed to look into allegations from the istas.\n",
      "In other words, there very well may be unmarked graves of Kanien’kehá:ka people, as the Mothers allege, and only time will tell.\n",
      "It’s an unprecedented move by a court that typically dismisses claims by a group without legal representation.\n",
      "It’s important to point out that not everyone agrees with the group in Kahnawake – some have come out and said so, for their own reasons – but if there ends up being graves there, the fight will have been worth the sacrifice and the long battle against Goliath.\n",
      "It made us think, however, that no matter what the outcome, EVERY dig in the city, the province, the country – especially one that was known to have artifacts, remains, and other related effects to our nation – needs real oversight.\n",
      "The city should institute such a committee at their own expense led by our people to further illustrate their commitment to this thing they call reconciliation.\n",
      "It’s the only way to preserve our history in this area – yes, naysayers, we were here for thou- sands and thousands of years, and weren’t just located in the Mohawk Valley – and to show they really want to honour us now as well as the graves of our ancestors.\n",
      "But we know money takes precedence over respect for Indigenous Peoples, and trying to convince a giant like Montreal to be led by Indigenous Tawits (Davids) is an uphill battle at best.\n",
      "It will slow down production and the economy, they will say. It would be impossible to do any- thing if something like an over- sight committee were erected, they will argue, but we will point to the fact that this is still unceded land, and we were never properly consulted or compensated for the hundreds of trillions of dollars we lost while the city was being erected on stolen ground.\n",
      "Besides, with huge projects all coming to a head at the same time – hello there, Lafontaine Tunnel – it’s not like the city itself has a good handle on building itself up efficiently, with minor inconvenience to the ones who live and visit there.\n",
      "Overlooking new building sites would become part of the process, and, once we have leaders who can really tackle the giants that are right next-door, reparations should not be far behind.\n",
      "Cripple your economy? How about supporting ours? We still haven’t fully explored that elephant in the room and it isn’t going to go away as long as independent, community-minded newspapers like The Eastern Door are around.\n",
      "We won’t let them forget, but we need help, of course.\n",
      "So the Kahnistensera Kanien’kehá:ka opened up a can of worms – although they weren’t exactly welcomed or supported by all at the beginning (or even now by some corners of the community) – that could very well change the course of history.\n",
      "A fight this big draws a line in the sand by demonstrating we were here first, this is our land, and we won’t stop fighting for it. It’s always a good day to remind everyone of those facts, especially the ones who walk among us and doubt our very real claims to Montreal.\n",
      "The fight is just beginning and the Mothers showed their resolve to keep going, in spite of obstacles, ridicule, and dirty tricks by the McGill lawyer who tried to paint them as a renegade group not supported by the Mohawk Council or community.\n",
      "As someone once said, tongue in cheek, “We’re Mohawks. Even we can’t tell our people what to do.”}]\n",

      "text : \n",
      "A spokesperson for the Mohawk Mothers, or Kahnistensera, says the group feels pushed aside in the search for unmarked graves on a site owned by Société Québécoise des Infrastructures, or SQI. McGill says it leases part of the property.\n",
      "“The process can no longer by any means be considered Indigenous-led, as the SQI and McGill attempt to control the whole process, reducing the role of Indigenous people to performing ceremonies on the site,” said Kahentinetha, one of the Mothers who added that they feel blindsided by the communications that happened without consulting them.\n",
      "Quebec’s infrastructure society, or SQI, and McGill both put out statements on Aug. 3 saying nine potential gravesites were identified through ground penetrating radar, or GPR, without consulting the Kahnistensera.\n",
      "They excluded the information that, according to Geoscan’s report, “It is possible that some of the unknown features may be unmarked graves, particularly in the case of older burials without coffins and also possibly child-size graves.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha said that the archeologists on-site have been very informative, but there’s often a delay in the mothers receiving important reports.\n",
      "“The only way we can find out is to be right there, because we are not told and I don’t know why the material goes to them, and then they distribute it in the way they want and eventually we get a copy of it,” she said. “It seems like this is violating the court order.”\n",
      "They were present on-site when archeologists also dug up a woman’s dress and a pair of children’s shoes, the style dating back to around the 1940s.\n",
      "But the archeologist panel appointed in the settlement agreement said that they need to appoint a forensic specialist to handle these items, something the SQI has refused, said researcher Philippe Blouin.\n",
      "“That has been refused now, officially, even though it was a recommendation from the panel, and their recommendations are supposed to be binding, as per the settlement agreement. It’s been refused by the SQI,” he said.\n",
      "In an email statement to APTN News, the SQI stated that a bioarcheologist is present when archeological works are underway – but did not say whether they were trained in handling potentially criminal evidence.\n",
      "“The dress was found just a few inches inside the ground and then put in a plastic bag but it has to be a tamper-proof bag for it to stand in a criminal court. There are many chances that it is possible that this comes to a criminal court and this chain of custody has to be preserved for this prosecution to be successful,” said Blouin.\n",
      "Blouin said they also have left partially covered piles of dirt to sit in the rain since July 25 that was dug up where sniffer dogs detected the scent of human remains in early June.\n",
      "“The piles have not been sifted through, and that was also a recommendation from the panel that was not respected by the SQI to sift through these piles that were extracted from the site where the search dogs sniffed a target to sift through them immediately because the human remains could be inside these piles.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha said that in the midst of these recommendations being ignored, “Despite publicly stating their support for the process and commitment to reconciliation, McGill and SQI have unilaterally deemed the panel’s mandate terminated.”\n",
      "This would mean that archeological works would continue with the firm Ethnoscope, but they would be guided by McGill and SQI, rather than a panel of expert archeologists. The SQI stated that the archeologist’s panel had the mandate to submit two reports of recommendations, one being submitted on May 8 and the other on July 17. The SQI said they were “very satisfied by and grateful for the work accomplished by the experts.”\n",
      "The settlement agreement states, “SQI, McGill and the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera agree to be bound by the recommendations of the Panel as to the Techniques and agree to be guided by the recommendations of the Panel as to the specialists to carry out the techniques and analyse the relevant data, but McGill and SQI retain discretion to retain other providers with the appropriate qualifications and expertise if the circumstances warrant.”\n",
      "The Kahnistensera also don’t want to return to work until they have mohawk security guards after a security guard appointed by a private company hired by SQI kicked them off the grounds on July 25.\n",
      "“We need to have our own people to do the security. and we do have a group in Kahnawake ready to come and do it, and we’re working on bringing them in.”\n",
      "Archeological digs have been suspended since that incident.\n",
      "The SQI and McGill both said that dialogue is underway with the Kahnistensera. In an email statement to APTN, the SQI did not say whether they’d hire a Mohawk security form, but said the agents assigned to the site would receive “awareness training about Indigenous realities including a portion on residential schools and missing children” as well as “a specific training on Mohawk culture provided by the Mothers.”\n",
      "The Kanistensera and their allies are prepared to return to court if the SQI and McGill continue to breach the settlement agreement.\n",

      "text : \n",
      "On July 25, the Kanien’kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) were verbally assaulted by security personnel on McGill’s New Vic project site. A week later, on Aug. 3, McGill issued a comprehensive press release about the ongoing investigation into the New Vic project site, announcing that nine anomalies were found during archaeological work. However, the Mohawk Mothers soon released their own statement, alleging that McGill and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) had failed to report all the findings on the site and isolated the Mothers from the investigation. \n",
      "The Mothers have been present for the archaeological excavation on the New Vic site, alongside archaeologists and security personnel hired by SQI as stipulated by their settlement agreement with McGill, the SQI, the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), the City of Montreal, and the Attorney General of Canada. Court-appointed Indigenous cultural monitors—who are responsible for performing cultural ceremonies and ensuring that excavation is completed in accordance with Indigenous protocols—have also been present on the site.\n",
      "In an interview with The Tribune, Mohawk Mother Kwetiio shared that on the afternoon of July 25, the Mothers and cultural monitors were on the New Vic site taking a virtual meeting when archaeologists informed them that work would end earlier than usual that day. As the meeting was wrapping up, Kahentinetha, another of the Mothers, decided to walk up the hill on the New Vic site, prompted by one of the cultural monitors. \n",
      "“After we finished our meeting […], Kahentinetha was coming down the hill towards us from the security guards and said, ‘They’re calling the police.’ I was startled,” Kwetiio said. “I went up the hill […], and [a member of the Mothers’ team, Alex*] came along with me.” \n",
      "Alex pulled out their phone to record the interaction. However, when the pair got to the top of the hill, a security guard whose name remains unknown snatched Alex’s phone out of his hands.\n",
      "“She grabbed [the phone] and started hollering at [Alex] that ‘No, I’m not being filmed, and you have no right,’” Kwetiio said. “And here’s me being like, ‘Wait a minute, calm down, like there are older people here.’” \n",
      "The security guard then handed Alex’s phone to another security guard, who stopped the recording and deleted it from the device. Kwetiio explained that the interaction became increasingly hostile when the security guard told the Mothers that they were not allowed to be present on the property unless they had a court order and demanded that the Mothers show her the document. \n",
      "“I said, ‘[…] You’ve been here all week. I’m pretty sure you know who we are, and you know why we’re here. And if you give [Alex] back [their] phone, [they] can pull it up on our email, and you will see the court order,’” Kwetiio said. \n",
      "The security guard went on to threaten to call the police numerous times. In an interview with The Tribune, Mother Kahentinetha shared some of the remarks the security guard made toward the Mothers. \n",
      "“[The security guard] says, ‘You should have some kids to take care of,’ or something like that. I said, ‘We had kids, but they ended up here in McGill and they were tested on.’ She says, ‘That’s a lie, that’s a lie.’ And I said, ‘Well, that did happen, and you got the benefit from this.’ And that’s when she said, ‘Yes, we sure did. We got the benefits,’” Kwettio said. \n",
      "The security firm did not respond to The Tribune’s request for comment. \n",
      "Since the altercation, the cultural monitors have refused to be present for additional work on the site until a resolution is reached. As the monitors must be present for any onsite work, the archaeological efforts were halted on July 26 but resumed Aug. 23.  \n",
      "A private meeting to discuss the altercation took place on Aug. 1, with the Mothers, the SQI, cultural monitors, and a representative of the Office of the Independent Special Interlocutor, Kimberly Murray, present. The Mothers pleaded with the defendants to hire a Kahnawake-based security firm to patrol the site, which was initially met with resistance from the defendants. However, all parties are in ongoing negotiations to potentially hire a Mohawk security firm. Currently, an SQI-appointed security firm continues to oversee the project’s security, while two representatives from a security firm chosen by the Mothers are also to be present on the site. \n",
      "While work remains halted after the altercation, ground penetrating radar (GPR)—a non-intrusive method of surveying and mapping land—has already been used on the site. On Aug. 3, McGill Provost and Vice Principal Christopher Manfredi issued a press release to all students and staff informing them that the GPR was performed by Geoscan—a geophysical archaeological firm that was recommended by the appointed panel of archaeologists. He shared that GeoScan’s findings have deemed that “no likely grave-type features [were] identified across the site,” but that nine anomalies, containing potential grave-type features, were found. \n",
      "According to anthropologist and associate of the Mothers, Phillipe Blouin, McGill’s announcement failed to include numerous additional findings. He explained that while only the nine reported anomalies were the correct size to be potential adult burial sites, several others of different sizes  were omitted from the press release. \n",
      "“There’s a much larger number of unknown anomalies [where] it’s possible that there are graves of children or graves without coffins,” Blouin said. “These results have been squarely silenced, denied, and minimized by the SQI.” \n",
      "SQI asserted that they have not denied or minimized the results of Geoscan’s report in a written statement to The Tribune. They stated that Geoscan indicated that the features of the “unknown anomalies” are not necessarially indicative of graves. \n",
      "In an interview with The Tribune, Associate Provost Angela Campbell explained that the reason McGill’s press release did not include the unknown anomalies was because the nine conclusive findings were of the most interest to the McGill community. The additional discoveries were highly unlikely to be potential graves, and were not definite findings. \n",
      "“[Our press release] wanted to communicate things that were certain,” Campbell said. “What was certain is that there’s nine potential unmarked sites, and so that’s where the work would begin [….] There’s no denying that there were many [findings] that were called an unknown source.”\n",
      "Blouin explained that the panel of archaeologists wanted to review and characterize the found anomalies, in addition to allowing the Canadian Archaeological Association (CAA) to peer review the data. However, the service providers would not allow this. \n",
      "SQI argued that the panel of archaeologists’ mandate was limited to identifying the appropriate archaeological techniques for the site and recommending service providers to carry out such techniques. They stated that it was never agreed upon to allow the panel to review or interpret the data obtained by the GPR. \n",
      "Additionally, Campbell explained that Geoscan was a service provider recommended by the panel of archaeologists. She also stated that as GeoScan is one of the most qualified archaeological firms in the country, she felt that it should be entrusted with the interpretation of GPR findings. \n",
      "“We need to be able to trust that company to collect and interpret their own data,” Campbell said.\n",
      "“That’s the reason why we don’t feel that we ought to subject the data to a second review. That company has the expertise, and we have to have the confidence in them to do that work.” \n",
      "While the investigation was halted, excavated soil remained above ground, which the Mothers worried could be damaged by weather conditions. \n",
      "“That is soil that is supposed to be sifted for human bones, and it’s left to the rain [….] It’s extremely improper for any type of archaeological inventory, and even more when there’s potential criminal ramifications and forensics,” Blouin said. \n",
      "In an interview with The Tribune, Executive Director of the New Vic project Pierre Major clarified that while the soil left on top of the land has been documented and covered with tarps during the investigation’s halt, the soil is unlikely to contain evidence. \n",
      "Direct excavation has resumed in recent weeks in the areas flagged by search dogs. However, the Mothers still feel there is a lack of sufficient communication and cooperation from the defendants. \n",
      "“The SQI and McGill are taking every little grey area that we haven’t created a protocol for, and they’re using those grey areas to try and take over the investigation and not make it Indigenous-led,” Kwetiio said. \n",

      "The Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) are deeply concerned about McGill and the Société Québécoise des Infrastructures’ (SQI) recent actions in the archaeological search for unmarked burials at the New Vic site.\n",
      "Despite publicly stating their support for the process and commitment to reconciliation, McGill and SQI have unilaterally deemed the panel’s mandate terminated, without following through on several recommendations which they agreed to be bound by in the Settlement Agreement signed in April 2023 and homologated in the Quebec Superior Court.\n",
      "McGill and the SQI have recently rejected recommendations from the Panel to include a forensics expert to oversee the chain of custody of artefacts, which is an essential aspect of a credible investigation. The Settlement Agreement had resulted from an injunction won by the Mohawk Mothers in October 2022 halting the New Vic construction project to allow an “Indigenous-led” investigation of unmarked graves. The process can no longer by any means be considered “Indigenous-led”, as the SQI and McGill attempt to control the whole process, reducing the role of Indigenous people to performing ceremonies on the site. One panel member has put forth her resignation in the wake of these troubling developments.\n",
      "Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha declared the turn of events “deplorable”, while Mohawk Mother Kwetiio stated that “it is very unfortunate that the SQI, as a public institution from Quebec, prefers to invest the population’s money in keeping Indigenous elders from discovering the truth about what happened to their children by fighting them in court. We were hoping for an amicable and open dialogue to resolve the disagreements in implementing the Settlement Agreement, but it is not acceptable to our people that Quebec and McGill entirely control an investigation searching for the unmarked graves of potential victims of those institutions in the past.”\n",
      "On August 3rd, 2023, McGill University and the SQI published newsletters disclosing part of the results of a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey performed by Geoscan on July 24, 2023, which we received the day before August 2nd, 2023. The newsletters are attached to this press release. The SQI and McGill did not consult the Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) before making it public.\n",
      "The two newsletters sent to the general public and media contain misleading information that must be corrected. The SQI’s newsletter suggests that “to date, no burials have been found” after the manual searches of the area where search dogs detected the scent of human remains. This fails to mention the discovery of important evidence in the soil excavated until now, including a young woman’s dress and an old pair of children leather shoes. They also fail to mention the verbal attack of Mohawk cultural monitors and elders on the site last week, who were evicted and verbally aggressed by unidentified security guards under the direction of the SQI, who also illegally grabbed someone’s telephone to erase the content of a video that was taken.\n",
      "Regarding the GPR report, the SQI and McGill’s newsletters mislead the public into believing that only nine (9) anomalies were found in the rather small zone that has been surveyed so far, the “priority zone” where they want to start construction work. A far greater number of “unknown” targets were detected by the GPR team, who suggest that “It is possible that some of the unknown features may be unmarked graves, particularly in the case of older burials without coffins and also possibly child-size graves.” The burials currently being searched for following the testimonies of survivors of medical experiments at the former hospital are those of children who would likely have been clandestinely buried without coffins.\n",

      "The Mohawk Mothers, or Kanien’kehà:ka Kanistansera, obtained a temporary injunction against McGill University to stop the renovation and excavation of a hospital where group says unmarked graves are located.\n",
      "“I feel like I just had a new baby, I do, because I feel like we’re closer to having our future generations heard, our past generations heard, and whatever has happened to our children, that they have purpose,” said Kwetiio, one of the Mothers.\n",
      "Kwetiio, Kahentinetha and Karennatha represented themselves in court against several lawyers representing the defendants: McGill University, Société québécoise des infrastructures, the City of Montreal and the Attorney General of Canada, among others.\n",
      "“You’ve never seen a case like this because there hasn’t been one. And quite frankly, the fact that Indigenous people can get justice in a courtroom is, it just goes to prove that we’re not completely shut out, but it does take extraordinary measures,” said lawyer Donald Worme, who, along with lawyer Julian Falconer, were present at the hearing as legal counsel for Kimberly R. Murray, the Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools.\n",
      "Calling themselves “traditional custodians of the land,” they presented their evidence before the court, including testimony from MK-Ultra psychological experiments survivor Lana Ponting, who said she had seen Indigenous children at the hospital when she was there and witnessed clandestine grave-digging in her affidavit.\n",
      "They also presented research detailing the historic use of Indigenous children for medical experiments throughout the 20th century.\n",
      "The judge said he hoped that this temporary injunction would allow more time for parties to engage in discussion so that the voices of the Kanistansera could be heard, and potentially pursue non-invasive modes of the archeological survey so the evidence would not be destroyed.\n",
      "“The Mohawk Mothers took the weight of this on their shoulders without legal representation. The number of government parties in the room? Mind-boggling,” said Falconer.\n",
      "“What came out of all of this is probably one of the most striking David and Goliath stories I have seen in a long time.”\n",
      "Arkéos, the archeological firm hired by McGill to undertake an archeological survey of the grounds, had been digging on the site with a bobcat two weeks before the injunction ruling was made.\n",
      "Two weeks prior to the Mohawk Mothers’ injunction hearing, the firm said that the likelihood of unmarked graves was “very low.”\n",
      "However, Karohia’no:ron Dallas Canady-Binette, a Mohawk archeology student from Kanesatake, said that the project failed to properly include Indigenous consent.\n",
      "“A big issue for me is that the Kanistansera at least have said that what they prefer is non-invasive methods. And they’ve said that several times that they’d prefer ground-penetrating radar, LIDAR, or aerial surveillance to be used as opposed to starting to dig,” he said.\n",
      "There is also evidence that the site might have been home to a pre-colonial Iroquois village, something a 2016 Arkéos study also indicated.\n",
      "Karohia’no:ron wrote an op-ed in the McGill Tribune criticizing Arkéos’ past archeological survey of those grounds. In 2016, McGill administration hired Arkéos to determine whether construction on the New Vic site would destroy any archeological artifacts — but failed to consult with any Indigenous people or use any Indigenous sources.\n",
      "“What [Arkéos] did do is consult historical documents, they consulted geographical data about the environment, what kind of soil, stuff like that. They also constructed building, like planning documents from the city of Montreal, but there was no Indigenous perspective. They didn’t consult any knowledge keepers, they didn’t consult any documents even that were written by Indigenous peoples and specifically kanie’keha’ka,” said Karohia’no:ron.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers repeated that no kaniekehaka consent was given for the New Vic project.\n",
      "The Mohawk Council of Kanawake (MCK) was consulted, but as Chief Ross Montour from MCK told APTN News in a phone interview, McGill’s campus falls out of MCK jurisdiction. MCK is therefore unable to either approve or veto a project.\n",
      "Mountour said the council was kept up-to-date with developments on the land, and mentioned that two First Nations representatives from Akwesasne were overseeing Arkéos’s archeological survey.\n",
      "These digs sparked resistance from some McGill students, including the student executive and McGill’s Divest student group.\n",
      "Val Masny, vice-president (external) of McGill’s student executive felt the university was rushing the process.\n",
      "“If there’s even like a one percent chance that there are unmarked graves, we need to do things properly. Like to me it’s not a question of probability, it’s just a question of doing things the right way,” said Masny.\n",
      "McGill students rallied outside the Montreal courthouse in solidarity with the Mohawk Mothers on Oct. 26 and many were present in the courtroom.\n",
      "But not everyone in kanawake feels represented by the Mohawk Mothers.\n",
      "APTN spoke with Debbie Delisle, a Mohawk Mother of the Turtle Clan, prior to the judges’ ruling. She’s also the elder in residence for McGill’s social work program.\n",
      "“Everybody has a right to express whatever, and however. Is an injunction [right]? Not really, because they haven’t spoken to me. They haven’t presented their issue to the community. Can we invite the community to a gathering so we can express our concerns about it,” said Delisle.\n",
      "Delisle said she would be willing to engage with the Mohawk Mothers provided they are open to discussion.\n",
      "McGill did not respond to APTN’s request for comment and Arkeos was not available for an interview before deadline.\n",
      "The case will be revisited in court towards the end of January early February at a case management hearing to see how both parties are doing with the discussions. At that time, if needed, a date will be set for another injunction hearing.\n",

      "Pope Francis’s landmark apology over residential schools drew sharp criticism from Indigenous spokespeople in Montreal — with one Mohawk women’s group even calling for the cross on Mount Royal to be taken down as an act of contrition.\n",
      "On Wednesday, two days after apologizing in Edmonton to Indigenous Peoples for the role the Roman Catholic Church played in Canada’s residential school system, the pontiff expressed his “deep shame and sorrow” and sought forgiveness for “the wrong done by so many Christians” during an address in Quebec City. He has described the Canadian trip as his “penitential” journey.\n",
      "Although he branded the forced cultural assimilation of First Nations children a “deplorable evil” and “disastrous error,” Pope Francis hasn’t mentioned sexual abuse in his remarks since landing in Canada. He also hasn’t brought up the so-called Doctrine of Discovery, a centuries-old decree from the Vatican that countries such as Canada used to justify the colonization of Indigenous lands.\n",
      "“If everybody thought that was a solution, that apology, they all would have been there,” Kwetiio, a Kahnawake resident and spokesperson for a group known as the Mohawk Mothers, told reporters Wednesday in Mount Royal Park. “There’s no way you could drag me there. That’s what I think about that apology. It’s empty.”\n",
      "Added Kanesatake resident Karakwine, whose mother survived time in a residential school: “I’m not impressed. It doesn’t seem sincere. There were a lot of words but nothing concrete.”\n",
      "An estimated 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend residential schools, more than 60 per cent of which were run by the Catholic Church.\n",
      "Last year, the remains of more than 1,000 children — some as young as three years old — were found buried on sites of three former residential schools.\n",

      "McGill and SQI Ordered to Comply with Settlement Agreement and Reinstate Expert Panel\n",
      "After obtaining, one year ago to the day, a precedent-setting injunction halting excavation at the former Royal Victoria Hospital site to search for the unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments, the Mohawk Mothers, also known as the Kahnistensera, have won their bid for a safeguard order they presented at the Superior Court of Quebec on October 27, 2023.\n",
      "On November 20, 2023, Justice Gregory Moore issued a judgment ordering McGill University and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) to abide by the Settlement Agreement they had signed with the self-represented Indigenous plaintiffs on April 6, 2023, and to respect the recommendations of the Expert Panel of archaeologists they had jointly selected.\n",
      "Justice Moore’s judgement states that the SQI’s and McGill’s positionending the Expert Panel’s mandate on July 17th is “too restrictive,” asthe settlement agreement “does not set a term for the panel’sinvolvement in the on-going search for unmarked graves” (par 34).According to the Judge, “The delay and costs of the overall projectcannot justify the SQI’s and McGill’s unilateral reduction of theirobligations under the settlement agreement, especially when doing sowill cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs” (par. 39).\n",
      "For Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha, the Judgement is a relief. “We’ve fought so hard for two years to search for these missing children. Our community was targeted by genocide and our children were used as guinea pigs in these horrific experiments by the CIA to see how to kill the Indian in them. But since McGill and the SQI fired the Expert Panel we had no way to keep track and trust the results of the investigation, which was now being controlled by the perpetrators of crimes against our children. The point in signing the Settlement Agreement was to allow the experts to do their job, and we were betrayed. We had to do it all alone without lawyers, facing such powerful institutions. It wasn’t easy, but we made it. The Judge understood that the only way this can go is in a professional way, with independent experts to oversee everything and make sure our community is informed.”\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers submitted that McGill and the SQI had failed to implement numerous recommendations of the Expert Panel, notably refusing to share data from Ground Penetrating Radar surveys, refusing to adopt forensic precaution to protect the chain of custody of evidence, and depriving the Mohawk Mothers of access to crucial information such as contracts with specialists. Justice Gregory Moore found in favor of the Mohawk Mothers’ argument that the purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to rely on an independent and impartial Expert Panel to provide ongoing recommendations, in order to ensure that the New Vic Project would not result in the desecration of human remains, which survivors and search dogs indicated to be on the site.\n",
      "In August 2023, McGill and the SQI fired the Expert Panel, one of whom had recently resigned, after they asked to implement forensic measures and peer review data from Ground Penetrating Radar.\n",
      "Although Historic Human Remains Detection Dogs had detected the scent of human remains in the area in front of the Hersey Pavilion, McGill and the SQI declared that there was no evidence of burials there, suggested it was a false positive, and started large-scale non archaeological excavation in the zone. The Mohawk Mothers were concerned that development work in the area could start before the source of human remains in the zone was established, especially inside the Hersey Pavilion, because the dogs signaled remains next to the building's wall and because unexplained demolition work took place there.\n",
      "Justice Moore’s court ruling will allow for the independent Expert Panel to provide updated recommendations regarding the zone and the larger site, after being cut off from the investigation since August.\n",
      "On November 5, 2023, search dogs detected the scent of human remains in yet another zone, close to the Allan Memorial Institute where the CIA’s MK-Ultra experiments on brainwashing took place in the 1950’s and 1960’s.\n",
      "The parties will be back in court on December 1st to address a motion ordering the release of records withheld by the defendants.\n",
      "The Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) is a Kahnawake-based group that helps Indigenous women accomplish their traditional cultural duty as caretakers of the land, to protect all life, including their children and ancestors. They have been engaged in a legal challenge with promoters of the New Vic project to stall future excavation of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site until a proper archaeological investigation is conducted, using the traditional protocols of the Kaianere'kó:wa (Great Peace).\n",

      "A settlement agreement was reached Thursday between the Mohawk Mothers, an Indigenous group, and Montreal’s McGill university.\n",
      "“It entails an archeological plan. And it’s for the archeology, it’s not for either side,” said Kwetiio, one of the Mohawk Mothers.\n",
      "It details the approach towards appropriate archeological techniques to detect whether there are unmarked graves at the former Royal Victoria hospital.\n",
      "“That’s primarily what we’re here for, our children,” said Kwetiio. “To find out what our history is, and make sure that our children are put to rest in the proper way.”\n",
      "The archeology work has already begun on the site. Last year, Mohawk Mothers was successful in getting a Quebec judge to stop excavation.\n",
      "The group has alleged that Indigenous patients were buried at this site during the 1950s and ’60s, a site that is scheduled to be redeveloped by McGill.\n",
      "Thursday’s settlement agreement is seen as a success for the Indigenous group because they say that most of their demands were met.\n",
      "“This is wonderful that we finally got this going. It’s a big relief for us because it has been a lot of work,” said Kahentinetha, another Mohawk Mother. “It took a lot of work to do this and we’re grateful that we got it to this point and it’s going to keep going on.”\n",
      "“This was a time for a new relationship with the people what we live amongst and this is what our children needed,” Kwetiio said. “They need to be found and we’re not going to do this just for this.”\n",
      "Lana Ponting – now 81-years-old – was a patient in 1958 at the Allan Memorial institute, the former psychiatric hospital next to the old hospital site.\n",
      "“I firmly believe there are bodies buried on the Allan property,” Ponting said. “I went out one night. I snuck outdoors, saw people with shovels. They were digging and I wondered what they were digging, why they were digging at night.”\n",
      "McGill University tells CityNews in a statement that it’s pleased about reaching the settlement.\n",
      "“This agreement provides for an unprecedented collaboration between the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera, the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI), and McGill, which will shed light on allegations of the possible presence of unmarked graves on portions of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site,” the statement read.\n",
      "McGill also says the joint effort includes support for archival research and the appointment of a panel of expert archaeologists who will scan the site to determine appropriate techniques for archaeological work prior to the resumption of excavation at the site.\n",
      "“Culturally appropriate measures, such as the presence of cultural monitors on site during the archaeological work, to witness the work and conduct ceremonies, will be implemented,” it added.\n",

      "See the attached report from the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association with the details of their June 9, 2023 search of the old Royal Victoria Hospital grounds.\n",
      "SQI requested that OVSARDA provide Historical Human Remains Detection Dogs (HHRDDs) to assist in the search for potential unmarked graves on the grounds of the old Royal Victoria Hospital. A portion of the property had been surveyed and HHRDDs had been recommended as a potential tool by a panel of 3 archaeologists (PRELIMINARY REPORT of the mapping mandate,Old Royal-Victoria Hospital site) Specifically, dog teams were tasked to search zones 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 15, as identified in the above report.\n",
      "Three HHRDD teams were used in the search. All three teams are currently certified in Human Remains Detection by the North American Police Work Dog Association. Each dog searched the entire assigned area once. Specifically, each dog team searched the entirety of Zones 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 15.No handler watched any of the other dog teams work. As such, no handler had any knowledge of another team’s results before searching themselves ie the search was ‘blind’ for all.When detecting a target odour, dogs may give alerts and/or a trained Final Response (TFR). An alert is defined by the Scientific Working Group on Dogs and Orthogonal Detection (SWGDOG) as “A characteristic change in ongoing behaviour in response to a trained odour, as interpreted by the handler.” A TFR is defined as “A behaviour that a dog has been trained to exhibit in the presence of a target odour source. During this search, handlers were to record both alerts and TFRs. After all three teams had completed their search, handlers would then compare their results and observations.\n",
      "All alerts noted by handlers were worked until they concluded in a TFR.All three dog teams reported a TFR in the same location, +/- 2m. The coordinates for this TFR (red dot on image below) are:\n",
      "Given that three separate dog teams indicated the same location independently with a TFR, we are confident that the odour of human remains is in this area.The wind direction, the building wall adjacent to the indications, the presence of an alcove, could suggest that odour is being blown into/contained at the location of the TFRs. Dogs indicate the area of strongest odour, which is not always the location of the source of the odour. The source of the odour could be right where the indications happened or could be further out from the building in an upwind direction. However, the further odour travels on the wind the more it spreads into a wider cone. The proximity of all dogs’ indications suggests that, if odour is being blown into the alcove area, it is not being blown in from a significant distance. We can only guess at what ‘significant’ means in this context, but a reasonable guess would be 10m or less.\n",

      "A group called the Mohawk Mothers (kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera) is demanding “the immediate suspension” of McGill University’s expansion plan for the old Royal Victoria Hospital site, and an investigation into the possibility there could be unmarked graves of Indigenous children there.\n",
      "The group claims to have recently interviewed Lana Ponting, an 80-year-old woman who says she was subjected to psychiatric experiments by Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron at McGill’s Allan Memorial Institute, in April 1958, at the age of 16. The woman reportedly said there were many Indigenous children at the Institute, and also that there were rumoured to be bodies buried around the premises, including near the Henry William Morgan Pool.\n",
      "Dr. Cameron subjected hundreds of patients to experiments between 1948 and 1964, using massive amounts of mind-altering drugs and repeated bouts of electroconvulsive shock therapy. The experiments were funded by the Canadian government and, in part, by the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency, which was funnelling money to mind-control research around the continent. The Mohawk Mothers highlighted the period between 1954 and 1963, when experiments were conducted as part of the CIA’s MKUltra program.\n",
      "“First of all, there are Iroquois villages (under) there,” said Kahentinetha, a spokesperson for the Mohawk Mothers. “So we want to investigate that and ask questions about it.\n",
      "“Those are our children that would be in unmarked graves. Several people who had been (at the Allan Memorial Institute) at the time in the ’50s and ’60s told us they themselves had seen Indigenous children there.”\n",
      "Part of the group’s contention is that McGill and the Royal Victoria Hospital site are on unceded Indigenous land. The group sent a letter of objection to McGill principal and vice-chancellor Suzanne Fortier in 2015, stating the university was built on Indigenous land without consent, using “unrepaid borrowed Iroquois trust funds,” but received no response from McGill.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers have again requested a meeting with Fortier, and will have a hearing on the topic with the Office de consultation publique de Montréal on Nov. 10.\n",
      "“It has to be proven to our satisfaction that there are no bones or bodies in unmarked graves,” Kahentinetha said, “so we want to declare this a crime scene. The entire McGill University is a crime scene.\n",
      "“We want this investigated before anything is done at this place. … Our main concern is our children, who are crying for us. We can hear them, and feel them. We know they want the story about what happened to them to be revealed.”\n",
      "Reached by email Tuesday afternoon, McGill spokesperson Cynthia Lee said the university is “deeply committed to meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities as per the Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education, and more specifically in connection with its New Vic project initiative.”\n",
      "Since January, Lee said, the university has engaged in information and roundtable sessions with Indigenous education organizations, Mohawk alumni, and elders. She added that McGill has held more than a dozen meetings with First Nation groups and Indigenous representatives regarding the New Vic project.\n",
      "In 2016, the university commissioned a study on the archeological potential of the Royal Victoria Hospital site.\n",
      "“According to this study, it is unlikely that Indigenous remains will be found on the New Vic Project site,” Lee said. “However, should this be the case, it will be made public immediately, the work will be suspended, and an archeological officer of the Minister of Culture and Communications will be alerted (as stated in the Cultural Heritage Act).\n",
      "“The university’s Indigenous Initiatives Unit would also be informed in order that the proper Indigenous protocol be followed with respect to honouring Indigenous ancestors.”\n",

      "Cadaver dogs have detected potential human remains on McGill University grounds where a group called the Mohawk Mothers believe unmarked graves exist.\n",
      "On June 9, 2023, three cadaver dog teams from the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association scoured the grounds under the supervision of archeologists, dog handlers and two Kanieke’haka cultural monitors.\n",
      "All dogs signaled that they detected human remains in front of the Hersey Pavillion, which was the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital’s nurses’ sleeping quarters.\n",
      "“Given that three separate dog teams indicated the same location independently with a TFR, we are confident that the odour of human remains is in this area,” said the report.\n",
      "This was part of the archeological procedures mandated in a settlement agreement reached in early April between McGill University, Quebec’s infrastructure society, the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) and the Mohawk Mothers, or Kanistansera, six women from Kahnawake.\n",
      "The Kanistensera allege that unmarked graves of victims of the MK-ULTRA mind control experiments from the 1950s and 1960s may be found on the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital and the old Allan Memorial institute, where McGill plans to build the New Vic project, a renovated facility.\n",
      "Since the site was detected, archeological procedures have been halted and the parties involved in the agreement have returned to the negotiating table to determine how to handle these new developments.\n",
      "McGill has been attempting to go forward with the New Vic project, which would revamp the old Royal Victoria site – which neighbours the AMI where CIA- and Canadian-funded psychiatric experiments took place from 1957 to 1964. \n",
      "The Kahnistansera allege that there is a strong possibility that bodies of Indigenous children who they say were victims of botched psychiatric experiments are buried on the grounds of the Allan Memorial Institute (AMI), a former psychiatric hospital which is owned by McGill.   \n",
      "After a settlement agreement was reached in April, archeological works began to determine whether human remains were present on-site.\n",
      "At the case management hearing June 29, the Kanistensera and the special interlocutor on unmarked graves’ legal representation, Julian Falconer, stated that the settlement agreement was not sufficient to address these new developments.\n",
      "Section 17 of the agreement states that if a discovery is made, “McGill, SQI and the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera will seek the advice of the Panel [of archeologists] as to how to move forward.”\n",
      "McGill said it was following the mandates of the agreement.\n",
      "“As required the work has been stopped, security is patrolling, and fences have been put up,” said Doug Mitchell, McGill’s legal representative.\n",
      "Mitchell also stated they had filed a permit to begin archeological works to verify if human remains were present on the site of concern.\n",
      "While McGill and SQI said they were following the procedures outlined in the agreement by following the advice of the panel of archeologists, Falconer said “the [archeology] panel expressly stated they don’t have expertise on security recommendations” to prevent the site from being disturbed.\n",
      "Additionally, the Kanistensera said their cultural monitors have not seen the promised 24-hour surveillance of the site in question at McGill. One cultural monitor, Karonhia’nó:ron Dallas Binette of Kanesatake, said that during the archeological foot survey of the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital in May, he and the archeologists noticed recently disturbed ground behind the Ross Pavillion.\n",
      "“There were artifacts that were disturbed, mainly related to a dump behind the Ross Pavilion, but grounds being disturbed,” said Karonhia’nó:ron.\n",
      "“There was evidence of non-authorized persons being able to freely walk around the Royal Victoria and Allan Memorial site,” he said.\n",
      "Karonhia’nó:ron said that on June 9, “while the [cadaver] dogs were working, pedestrians were able to encroach on their space. This didn’t affect the work of the dogs, but just in terms of respecting the site archeologically. More needs to be done to protect the integrity of the land and people’s spirits.”\n",
      "The Kanistensera contested McGill’s claims that there has been sufficient security increased after the findings of the sniffer dogs.\n",
      "There are also concerns over the speed of handing over archival records. In the settlement agreement, the MUHC, McGill, and the Library and Archives Canada are supposed to expedite access to relevant archival records on those who may have attended the Allan Memorial Institute and been subject to the MK-ULTRA experiments to Know History, an independent history firm.\n",
      "However, the panel has only been contracted for six months to advise on archeological works on the proposed New Vic site.\n",
      "“If you don’t have access to the records in a timely way, then conclusions are tainted by that. You’re operating essentially in the blind. And so this accelerated timeline has meant the need for accelerated access to records and that’s not happening,” said Falconer in a post-hearing interview with APTN News.\n",
      "While MUHC, McGill and Library and Archives Canada stated they were in the process of handing over records, Falconer said he had received communication from Know History that cooperation was “not what it could be.”\n",
      "“What the defendants described in the case management meeting was their interpretation of how things are progressing,” said Falconer. “What I can tell you is we are getting reports directly back from Know History that simply don’t support that, as we indicated in court.”\n",
      "Judge Gregory Moore gave the Kanistensera three options: to expand the panel to include expertise in site security; to revisit the mediation process between the defendants and plaintiffs and possibly modify the settlement agreement; or to begin a litigation process against the defendants.\n",
      "The Kanistensera have until July 14 to decide how to proceed.\n",

      "As the sun set and cars lined up for the usual nighttime commute on Pine Ave., a group of protesters held a solemn march.\n",
      "Holding candles and with many wearing orange shirts, the marchers began at the top of Peel St., near the entrance to the Allen Memorial Institute, and walked slowly down to Sherbrooke St.\n",
      "The marchers were hoping to raise awareness to their demands that McGill University investigate claims of unmarked child graves on the site of the old Royal Victoria Hospital.\n",
      "For years, Mohawks have heard rumours and stories that there were Indigenous children taken to the site of the Allen, and had experiments done on them.\n",
      "Recently, a group called Mohawk Mothers (kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera) began gathering evidence and pressuring authorities to open a full-scale investigation. They recently interviewed Lana Ponting, an 80-year-old woman who says she was subjected to psychiatric experiments by Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron at McGill’s Allan Memorial Institute, in April 1958, at the age of 16. The woman reportedly said there were many Indigenous children at the Institute, and also that there were rumoured to be bodies buried around the premises, including near the Henry William Morgan Pool.\n",
      "“Our children are buried on these grounds,” said Kwetiio, a member of the group, who led the march. “Our investigation brought to light some instances where (Mohawk) children were experimented on. This is (Mohawk) land, and we have never given responsibility over that land to any of the past people who have acquired that land. Right now, that land needs to be investigated so that any projects that go ahead, they must ask permission from us for these things to happen.”\n",
      "The Mohawk mothers presented their evidence to the city’s Office de consultation publique de Montréal on Wednesday night. Kwetiio said the group would like to halt all efforts to develop the old Royal Victoria Hospital site until the claims are verified.\n",
      "“We would like to present our findings and have a conversation with McGill University and the grounds of Allen Memorial, because this needs to be rectified. There are too many of our children lost and not being found. There are too many entities not being held responsible for lands that were taken from us. They can’t take our children away from us any longer.”\n",
      "McGill spokesperson Cynthia Lee told the Montreal Gazette recently the university has engaged in information and roundtable sessions with Indigenous education organizations, Mohawk alumni, and elders.

      "“According to this study, it is unlikely that Indigenous remains will be found on the New Vic Project site,” Lee said.\n",
      "Kahentinetha, another group member, said there was an Indigenous village in the area hundreds of years ago, and the land has not been ceded to non-native people.\n",
      "“We are here today to tell people that we will never give you permission to do anything on our land,” she said. “Never.”\n",
      "Fernand Deschamps, an area resident, said he was there to give his support to the group.\n",
      "“As a Canadian and a Quebecer, I can’t accept this,” said Deschamps, wearing an orange shirt with the words ‘every child matters’ inscribed on it. “This question has to be looked at very seriously before we modernize or reconstruct in this area, that they be consulted. It’s the least we can do.”\n",
      "He said it’s easy to rally behind the cause, because of all the unmarked graves that have been discovered in recent months.\n",
      "“If you are a parent, if you have children, if your children die, you want them to have a dignified burial,” he said. “This is the least we can hope for.”\n",

      "A group of Indigenous women staged a protest on Mount-Royal Wednesday against Pope Francis' historic visit to Canada.\n",
      "The group, known as the Mohawk Mothers, said an apology for residential schools is an insult and what they want instead is action.\n",
      "That cross is a symbol of the oppression, they say, that the Catholic Church inflicted upon Indigenous communities through residential schools and other means. The group said removing it would be one concrete way to acknowledge that.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Pope Francis landed in Quebec City(opens in a new tab) as part of his six-day tour in Canada to apologize for the harm done by the Catholic Church in Canada's residential school system.\n",
      "The cross on Mount-Royal has been there for nearly a century. It commemorates the date on Jan. 6, 1643, when Paul de Chomedey, also known as the sieur de Maisonneuve, kept his promise to carry a wooden cross to the summit of Mount-Royal if the young colony of the Ville-Marie fort survived.\n",
      "The cross stands 30 metres high and when lit at night it can be seen from kilometres away.\n",
      "It is usually lit in white, but it can be purple to mark the death and election of a new Pope.\n",
      "But for the Mohawk mothers and others gathered in protest, the cross is a glaring reminder of all the terrible things the Catholic Church has done to Indigenous people.\n",
      "They say the Pope's visit is a waste of time and money and want concrete actions of reparations to Indigenous people for all the land that was taken from them.\n",
      "\"I would like that cross to be taken down. If you just look behind you, all of you, if you were to take a look around all the amounts of crosses that you see,\" said Kwetiio, one of the Mohawk Mothers.\n",

      "The Kahnistensera filed an Emergency Motion to halt drilling and excavation at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, which will be heard on Thursday September 14 at the Superior Court in Montreal. The Emergency Motion details breaches to the Settlement Agreement by McGill and the SQI that the Mohawk Mothers repeatedly raised in direct talks about significant concerns with the way they are handling the archaeological investigation ordered by the Quebec Superior Court to search for unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments.\n",

      "The same day, McGill University issued a message to all its staff and students, declaring that the investigation of the zone where they want to start work is complete, and produced no evidence of graves. The Mohawk Mothers see these developments as major provocations, as the investigation is far from complete and McGill’s messaging predominantly emphasizes favourable findings while concurrently concealing or downplaying several discoveries that confirm the possibility of unmarked burials at the New Vic site.

      "Following the recent discovery of the scent of human remains by Historic Human Remains Detection Dogs (HHRDD) on the grounds of the old Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) appeal to McGill University and the Government of Quebec to apply the same precautions for protecting potential remains on other similar sites. \n",
      "“It is our understanding that several other institutions in Quebec may contain unmarked graves of our children, not only in Indian Residential Schools or hospitals, but also in former sanatoria, orphanages and correctional homes,” said Kwetiio, one of the Mohawk Mothers. The Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera have obtained the first injunction ever granted to self-represented Indigenous people on October 27th, 2022, halting excavation work for McGill’s “New Vic” Project in the former Royal Victoria Hospital to search for unmarked graves following the testimonies of survivors of the MK-Ultra psychiatric experiments on mind control. During the hearing, McGill University and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) had started excavating the very same area where the dogs now found human remains, declaring that nothing had been found by archaeologists and that the New Vic construction project could begin. \n",
      "According to the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera, it is very likely that the human remains would have been destroyed by construction work if they did not intervene in court, despite lacking resources and legal assistance. “We should not have to go to court for this. Taxpayer money should not be spent on litigation against survivors and their family members who want to identify, protect and investigate the unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments”, says Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha, “they should collaborate from the onset to treat human remains with respect as responsible institutions would do”. The human remains were independently detected by three separate HHRDD handled by Kim Cooper, of the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association,on June 9, 2023, following a lengthy court process which led to a Settlement Agreement being homologated by the Superior Court of Quebec on April 20, 2023. \n",
      "Kimberly Murray, the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burials Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools, who intervened in the court proceedings, noted in her recently released Interim Report that “There is a need to expand the scope of research beyond Indian Residential Schoolsites.... Current investigations are beginning to reveal how the systems and patterns of colonial violence that existed in the Indian Residential School system extended to [other]associated institutions. ...Understanding the full scope of the forced transfer of children from one institution to the next and the conditions that led to their deaths will require significant time, funding, research, and long-term commitment to finding the truth.”\n",
      "TheMohawk Mothers urge McGill University and the McGill University Health Center to pause excavation work and large-scale renovation plans for hospitals and medical research centers who may contain the graves of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children as test subjects in the past. This includes not only the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, but also its main campus in downtown Montreal, where Iroquoian Longhouses and gravesites were repeatedly discovered, including at the intersection of Peel and Sherbrooke streets in 2018. On June 30th, 2023, the day following a court date where the HHRDD discovery was discussed, the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera were shocked to learn that McGill University had launched large-scale archaeological inventories next to the McLennan Library. McGill had not informed the Kahnistensera even though they had repeatedly expressed their vested interest in protecting the remains of their ancestors buried under the university in court. McGill University did not express whether Indigenous monitors and specialists in human burials were present at the archaeological site.\n",
      "Regarding the more recent remains of medical experiments, the Mohawk Mothers are concerned that Quebec is not taking its responsibility regarding the widespread abuse of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children such as the Duplessis Orphans in the past century. The Mohawk Mothers recently asked the Quebec government and the CIUSSS to halt the sale of the Hôpital de la Miséricorde, a former house for unwed mothers, to investigate the probability that it contains human remains; a meeting with the CIUSSS to discuss the demand will take place in Kahnawake on July 6th, 2023. “But we can’t run after the government all the time to make sure none of these sites where medical cruelty happened get desecrated or sold to get rid of them and the terrible evidence of the past they contain, says Kahentinetha. According to the Kahnistensera, the same type of agreement and investigation that resulted from the Royal Victoria Hospital Court Case should be followed in all other similar sites.\n",
      "The Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera(Mohawk Mothers) isa Kahnawake-based group that helpsIndigenous women accomplish their traditional cultural duty as care takers of the land, to protect all life, including their children and ancestors. They have been engaged in a legal challenge with promoters of the New Vic project to stall future excavation of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site until a proper archaeological investigation is conducted, using the traditional protocols of the Kaianere'kó:wa (Great Peace)\n",

      "Cadaver dogs conducting a search on the grounds of the Old Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal have discovered evidence of human remains, according to a new report.\n",
      "A group of Indigenous elders alleges that the site contains unmarked graves of Indigenous children who died as a result of mind-control experiments that took place in the 1950s and 1960s at a psychiatric institute affiliated with the former hospital.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers obtained an injunction last October(opens in a new tab) to pause excavation work done by McGill University at the site to expand its campus with a new research, teaching and learning hub. Both sides agreed in April to conduct a search for potentially unmarked graves(opens in a new tab).\n",
      "On Thursday, a report presented to the Quebec Superior Court said a team of three trained search dogs have pinpointed an area on the site possibly containing human remains near the Hersey Pavilion, a nurses' residence.\n",
      "\"Given that three separate dog teams indicated the same location independently with a TFR [Trained Final Response], we are confident that the odour of human remains is in this area,\" the report by the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association stated.\n",
      "A German Shepherd, a Dutch Shepherd, and a Malinois searched the site on June 9, alongside their dog handlers, archeologists and two Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera cultural monitors.Julian Falconer, a lawyer for the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools, an intervenor in the legal proceedings, was appointed to oversee the search.\n",
      "\"It's very important to understand it doesn't necessarily mean that there are human bodies located in the area all three teams identified, but certainly their function is to identify a specific odour and a target area, and these three sets of dogs did,\" he said in an interview Thursday.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers claim that they have evidence of graves from a survivor of the MK-Ultra mind-control experiments conducted at the Allan Memorial Institute on the Royal Victoria grounds.\n",
      "Canada and the CIA allegedly funded harmful psychological experiments(opens in a new tab) on vulnerable patients that included experimental drugs and rounds of electroshock therapy.\n",
      "The cadaver dogs' discovery is a major development in the construction project saga, which the Mohawk Mothers have been opposing since 2015.\n",
      "\"Of course, this has done nothing but multiply the anxiety and concerns of the Mohawk Mothers. And what you're seeing now playing out in real time and played out in court today is the level of upset this causes,\" Falconer said.\n",
      "Kwetiio, a Mohawk Mother, told CTV News that in an ideal scenario, there would be no unmarked graves on the grounds of the former hospital, but the recent discovery does provide some \"relief\" to Indigenous people that what they've been saying all along is likely true.\n",
      "\"They feel validated, that it's not just talk that they were saying, that is actually concluded to something. That relief, that comfort of knowing that somebody listened and did something about it and that we're gonna address it. It's going to be dealt with,\" Kwetiio said.\n",
      "She said Indigenous elders advocating for the work to be halted will be meeting in the coming days to decide the next steps.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers are also trying to resolve concerns they raised regarding inadequate security at the site and cultural protocols not being respected.\n",
      "McGill University says it's prepared to move forward with the second step of investigations: ground penetrating radar. That's expected to start later in the summer, the university wrote in a statement to CTV. \n",
      "The site itself is owned by the Societe quebecoise des infrastructures, which is mandated to redevelop the land. McGill is expecting to use about 15 per cent of the land for teaching and research. \n",
      "The university also renewed its vow to respect an agreement that \"Indigenous cultural monitors,\" who are appointed by the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera, will be on site during the investigation. \n",
      "\"McGill fully respects the agreement,\" wrote McGill. \n",

      "A Quebec Superior Court judge, Justice Gregory Moore, granted the Kanien’kehà:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) an interlocutory injunction on Oct. 27, after a two-day court hearing for the Mothers’ ongoing lawsuit against McGill over potential unmarked Indigenous graves on McGill’s New Vic site. This injunction will effectively halt all archeological work for approximately four months. \n",
      "An interlocutory injunction is a court order that prevents a party from performing certain actions until the final decision in a case has been made. In this case, McGill is still allowed to perform maintenance work on the site, but is prohibited from conducting any further excavation. Arkéos, the archeological firm hired by McGill, had begun excavation without the Mothers’ consent on Oct. 12.\n",
      "In an interview with The McGill Tribune, anthropologist and associate of the Mothers, Philippe Blouin, emphasized that the Mothers’ win is a historic achievement that establishes an important legal precedent. \n",
      "“It’s the first time in Canadian history that Indigenous people won without lawyers. This will be jurisprudence for future cases,” Blouin said. \n",
      "The two-day hearing saw arguments from both the Mothers and McGill, as well as Independent Special Interlocutor Kimberly Murray. The Mothers gave a presentation on the historical background of the case and recounted their past efforts. Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha also criticized McGill’s communication with the Mothers, which she described as negligent. \n",
      "“The only information we get is from McGill University’s Instagram photo-ops,” Kahentinetha said in court. \n",
      "Kahentinetha told the Tribune that during the proceedings, she voiced her frustration with McGill’s constant dismissal of the Mothers and their methods for handling the court case. Now that the judge has granted the injunction, she is looking forward to non-hostile discussions with McGill in the future. \n",
      "“We told them that we feel like we are being silenced,” Kahentinetha said. “We explained our frustration with the way we thought we were being mistreated, but it was basically a misunderstanding between us. And now, we’re going to be able to explain to them how we operate, which is very exciting.” \n",
      "McGill’s attorney, Doug Mitchell, debated with Murray and the Mothers over whether the Superior Court of Quebec was the appropriate setting for adjudicating this case. The Mothers countered that they had exhausted all channels outside of the court to express their concerns, and argued that the courtroom was their last resort.\n",
      "“[The Mothers] filed another affidavit [on] the first day of the hearing that showed all the different steps that they already took to try to voice their concerns,” Blouin said. “It was taken into account with the final report of the [Office de consultation publique de Montréal].”\n",
      "On the second day of the hearing, the Court established that it had the responsibility to act in an honourable way toward Indigenous peoples as stipulated by the honour of the Crown constitutional principle. The principle outlines that the government must “act with honour, integrity, good faith, and fairness in all of its dealings with Indigenous peoples.” \n",
      "In anticipation of the hearings, Divest McGill, a student-run environmental justice group, held events to mobilize the McGill community in support of the Mothers. One of the events was a protest outside of the Palais de justice de Montréal on Oct. 26. About 30 people attended, with some individuals inside the courthouse watching the hearing, while others watched the live stream from outside. Maya Garfinkel, U4 Arts and Divest organizer, believes that students must bear witness to McGill’s litigation in order to hold the administration accountable for its actions. \n",
      "“McGill’s strategy, as with many issues that McGill faces, has been to sweep things under the rug. So in order to combat that strategy of erasure, we need to do the opposite,” Garfinkel said in an interview with the Tribune. “We need to raise awareness and bring people into the fold who may not be aware of what is happening otherwise.” \n",
      "On Oct. 25, Divest held a movie screening in support of the Mothers, showcasing Kanehsatake, 270 Years of Resistance, a film about the Oka Crisis, or the Kanesatake Resistance—a confrontation between members of the Mohawk Nation and the city of Oka, which called in the Canadian army after trying to expand a golf course into a Mohawk burial ground.\n",
      "“It is ultimately a story of resilience, and we want to take that message of resilience forward as we continue to act in solidarity with the Mohawk Mothers and the Indigenous peoples in resistance across Turtle Island,” Garfinkel said.  \n",
      "Edna Isabel Mameanskum, a protestor and member of the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach, was present for the hearing, and condemned McGill’s alleged desecration of graves. She believes that the Canadian legal system is not built for handling issues regarding unmarked Indigenous graves, as there is no previous jurisprudence entailing how to deal with mass burial sites on unceded land. \n",
      "“I felt obligated to be here because everyone needs a proper burial. Why would you just go and move the bodies of children, especially children,” Mameanskum said in an interview with the Tribune. “I was inside and […] lawyers said they’re not qualified to make these kinds of decisions because their laws are white laws. He said we’re here because of colonialism. It really hit me [….] I felt chills.” \n",
      "Following his decision to grant an emergency injunction, Justice Moore commended Mohawk traditions of mediation. He encouraged both parties to uphold those principles instead of adversarial litigation. \n",
      "“He said that these talks should be inspired perhaps by the way discussions happen in the Longhouse and Mohawk tradition,” Blouin said. “The Mohawk Mothers are not opposing McGill per se. They respect their educational vocation, but […] this is a question of the land there. If McGill is standing on unceded land, it has to be dealt with in a respectful manner.” \n",
      "Kahentinetha emphasized that the long-standing Indigenous decision-making process should be of interest to all parties. She recounted a time when she taught members of the McGill community about the approach and the importance of constructive debating. \n",
      "“When we taught it the first time at McGill, we were there for a whole day,” Kahentinetha said. “We explained it to them, and gave them a problem to work on. They loved it. They said ‘this is the best decision-making system I’ve ever seen.’ This is not adversarial. This is one where people learn to understand each other. And in the end, people can become friends.”  \n",
      "The Mothers celebrated their win, but quickly returned to preparing for the collective discussions in four months. In the next hearing, which has yet to be scheduled, all parties will collectively determine the most effective and ethical archeological practice for performing work in a way that is respectful to the land and the potential remains.\n",
      "“We have four months to work out some kind of agreement on each side, so that we understand each other, what we’re trying to do, and just how this is going to be carried out,” Kahentinetha said. “We really want to start a good dialogue. That’s what we’re working towards, a peaceful dialogue with McGill.” \n",
      "McGill is also preparing for the collaborative discussions. McGill media relations officer Frédérique Mazerolle outlined McGill’s next steps after the court-ordered excavation postponement in an email to the Tribune. \n",
      "“The archaeological fieldwork […] is completed and the intervention did not lead to any archaeological discovery,” Mazerolle wrote. “Following the court decision this week, granting a short-term injunction to the defendants, McGill will examine the decision thoroughly over the coming weeks and will reach out to the special interlocutor to discuss ways of meeting the concerns that were raised.” \n",
      "The Mothers urge students to continue to peacefully support their case. In fact, student activism may have made a difference in the Mothers’ case, according to Garfinkel. \n",
      "“I was struck by the mentions of student activism and student voices even in the courtroom,” Garfinkel said. “For example, the Mohawk Mothers were able to leverage the fact that many students had spoken out against the issue during their statement in court, making it clear that […] there are many in McGill’s public, including in the student body, who oppose the way the project has been moving forward. It was clear that this statement had weight in the courtroom and we were proud to have contributed to that possibility.” \n",
      "The Mothers hope that their win will mark a new era of reconciliation at McGill.\n",
      "“Real progress can be made from here. It’s wonderful that we’re going to do this,” Kahentinetha said. “No more stress, no more fear, none of that. Can you imagine that after [500 years], we’re now going to be taken seriously?” \n",

      "During the university’s second Senate meeting of the academic year on Oct. 19, senators discussed the Kanien’kehá:ka Kahnistensera’s (Mohawk Mothers) legal dispute with McGill over the New Vic Project and the university’s COVID-19 protocols. The meeting began with memorial tributes for professors who had passed away this year, followed by opening remarks from interim principal and vice-chancellor Christopher Manfredi. \n",
      "After Manfredi’s opening remarks, those gathered launched into a discussion session about McGill’s controversial archeological work on the New Vic site. \n",
      "Senator David Vaillancourt questioned why McGill’s archeological approach deviates from the Canadian Archeological Association’s (CAA) framework for investigating sites of potential unmarked graves, a concern the Kahnistensera have also raised. Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Fabrice Labeau responded, justifying the archeological approach by claiming that the area under investigation may have Indigenous artifacts from pre-colonial times, but almost certainly does not have unmarked graves. \n",
      "“We are really looking at a place that is in front of the Hersey Pavilion, that is very far away from the Allen Memorial Hospital,” Labeau said. “The likelihood of unmarked graves in that area is very, very low [….] We also want to mention that the way the archeological search will be carried out later in other areas is not predetermined.”\n",
      "Dicki Chhoyang, McGill’s Director of Stakeholder Relations, stressed that Quebec, not McGill, is responsible for the site and that McGill’s efforts to investigate the Mohawk Mothers’ claims are simply out of care for the Indigenous community.(The Mothers have repeatedly stated that their treatment from McGill has been hostile.)\n",
      "“We spoke to the elected council of Kahnawake, communicated with Kanesatake, Akwesasne, Hurons-Wendat, Anishinabeg, the Assembly of First Nations,” Chhoyang said. “Then we reached out to all the elders, we explained to them, ‘we’re not officially responsible, but our community is very concerned, so in due diligence as a responsibility to them, we are reaching out to you. How would you like us to handle this?’”\n",
      "Senator Margaret Levey countered Labeau and Chhoyang by pointing out the benefits for the university of complying with the CAA’s guidelines and collaborating with the Kahnistensera.\n",
      "“Isn’t the advantage clear that it would be good publicity, that it would be a good step toward reconciliation?” Levey said.\n",
      "Senators then briefly discussed COVID-19 policies. Senator Miranda Hickman expressed a desire for greater information and guidance from the university surrounding the pandemic, particularly in light of the dissolution of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on COVID Academic Planning and Policies. \n",
      "“It is often hard to keep tabs on what’s happening around COVID-related issues […] and especially hard to tune into collective wisdom and best practices, as we all have to make ad hoc decisions in response to what is happening,” Hickman said. \n",
      "Associate Provost (Equity and Academic Policies) Angela Campbell responded that the committee on COVID-19-related issues was always meant to be temporary and that no revival of the committee is being considered at this time.\n",
      "Campbell later presented the new Regulations on Academic Staff Grievances and Disciplinary Procedures, which she had outlined at the Sept. 21 Senate meeting. The Senate approved these regulations.\n",
      "Moment of the meeting: During his opening remarks, Manfredi affirmed the University’s commitment to working with the re-elected Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government, and specifically the Minister of Education, to advance joint goals.\n",
      "Soundbite: “McGill here has an opportunity to model a form of collaboration and peacemaking in the process of developing the New Vic [….] It seems collaborating with the Mothers would be far less expensive, time-consuming than a court case, and it’s difficult to understand why McGill is so certain that no remains will be found, why they would not choose to hear the Mothers.” \n",

      "Mohawk Mothers won several court injunctions to stop construction and investigate unmarked graves at McGill University. McGill has fought them every step of the way. Read the updates for details of the egregious assault committed against the Mohawk Mothers working at the site on July 25th, 2023.\n",
      "By now, most people know that some Canadian institutions buried children in unmarked graves on site. These deaths were most likely caused by human medical experimentation, starvation, beating, sexual abuse, terror, illness and a 1000 other reasons that one only needs to imagine in the dark recesses of the human mind.\n",
      "Now, McGill University wants to renovate its lands without consultation or consent with the Mohawk Mothers of Quebec. Evidence exists that first nations children were among the many peoples used in illegal dark lab medical/military experiments done on unsuspecting patients of Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allan Memorial Institute, at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Testimony exists that children were disposed of on site at the location in Montreal, Canada.\n",
      "Families of victims of the Montreal Experiments stand with the Mohawk Mothers of Montreal in demanding independent investigations into the allegations to resolve the matter.\n",
      "While 1000's of apologies and compensation packages for lesser crimes exist, the victims of the Montreal Experiments, are still waiting for justice. Please join us to let McGill University know that the cover up and denial ends now.\n",
      "Please support our call for justice today through moral imperative or legal injunction on McGill University to stop renovations that will destroy evidence forever if not investigated properly.\n",

      "“If everybody thought that was a solution, that apology they all would’ve been there. There’s no way you could drag me there,” said Mohawk Mother Kwetiio.\n",
      "An Indigenous group is calling out the Catholic church and the Pope’s visit calling his apology unwanted and meaningless without action.\n",
      "They say this cross on Montreal’s mount royal is a symbol of pain and a reminder of the church’s involvement with residential schools.\n",
      "“You’ve taken land. You’ve taken people, you’ve exploited us. You’ve tried to commit genocide on us. Yet this symbol still stands everywhere we look,” said Kwetiio.\n",
      "“Right now, there’s how much money being spent and how much focus being put on the Pope. But I don’t see the real issues at hand. Also, he could make an apology. What does that do? What does an apology do? Oh, I’m sorry. When was the last time any one of you sat down with a murderer, rapists, thief, colonizer, genocidal person and sat down with them so they could say sorry to you? That’s the entity that I represent, and we can’t stand for that.”\n",
      "The group of Mohawk Mothers from Kahnawake say they’re fed up with empty words\n",
      "“We need action. We need to do something. We need the people on this that live on this island with us to understand what has happened to us and that we’re not going to allow it to continue,” said Kwetiio.\n",
      "“The doctrine of discovery must be revoked. And I think that’s one of the primary things that we need to have done, that the revoking of the of. And you know what that is the reason for being here, you be here is something very false. And I think that has to be removed. And all of this victimization of our people has to stop,” said Mohawk Mother Kahentinetha.\n",
      "Resilience Montreal echoed the Mohawk Mothers’ sentiments, releasing a statement that read in part “an apology alone cannot mend lives forever changed.”\n",
      "While the apology represents a step towards healing for some, it fails to address the impacts of the deep intergenerational trauma that many continue to experience daily.\n",
      "“Somebody got something out of it. And it’s that’s what makes them relieved. Then good for them. And I really do hope that they heal from something. But to those of us that understand where all this pain and trauma and death and murder and rape and so on and so on came from, that’s not enough,” said Kwetiio.\n",
      "“The Pope. Did he ever ask the first people here who own the land for him to invite him here? He never asked us, ever. He never asked,” said another Mohawk Mother.\n",
      "“Nobody asked him to come here. I don’t want. I don’t want him back on my land the last time. And every time that it’s come, it hurts our people. More and more to think of the the injustice that that entity that he represents is here is here in my face. In our faces. And that gets more attention than the people that are here trying to save our land and save our culture and save our people and our babies from having repeated abuse on us,” said Kwetiio.\n",

      "Meaning “Two Mountains”, Tekanontak is the traditional Kanien'kehá:ka name of Mount Royal, at the heart of Montreal. It is the location of the Iroquoian village that Jacques Cartier, the first French explorer of the region, witnessed in 1525, and sheltered an estimated 3000 inhabitants in 50 to 70 longhouses. A crucial location from which all the surrounding waterways can be observed, Tekanontak was used to send smoke signals that were picked up in the Adirondaks before making their way down the East Coast, according to Indigenous oral history. It was and remains one the largest burial sites in North America. \n",
      "Mount Royal is the only location with both a Natural and Heritage Site status in Quebec, which means that it is supposed to be protected and controlled by special provincial and municipal rules under Quebec’s Cultural Heritage Act.\n",
      "Established in 1893, the Royal Victoria Hospital is part of the McGill University Health Center. Once considered a hospital for the poor, it served many Indigenous and Inuit patients. The hospital closed and moved to a new site in 2015, in what was both the biggest relocation and the biggest financial fraud in Canadian history.\n",
      "Built in 1863 to serve as a villa for Sir Hugh Allan, a shipping magnate and wealthy railway promoter, the Institute was absorbed into the Royal Victoria Hospital by 1940 and became a psychiatric ward in 1944. The CIA’s MKULTRA medical program experiments were conducted in the building between 1957 and 1964. Under the direction of its founding director, Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, the medical experiments centered on developing drug-induced mind control. \n",
      "In the mid-1800s, a loan by the Province of Canada saved McGill University from financial crisis. Money for the loan was borrowed from Six Nations’ Trust Funds without the consent of the communities. While the university paid off the loan in 1881, money borrowed from the Six Nations Trust Funds was never reimbursed.\n",
      "Established in 1642 by the French, Montréal was never surrendered by its Indigenous inhabitants, whose traditional legal framework and governance system remains in effect. Section 35 of the Constitution of Canada,1982 “recognizes and affirms Aboriginal rights,” and considers all inconsistent laws “null and void”. \n",
      "Evidence of Montreal’s historical Indigenous presence has been consistently destroyed for the sake of the city’s development and expansion. Now that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has found that the residential school system amounted to a cultural  genocide of Indigenous people, the Mohawk Mothers consider that its subsoil must be preserved as forensic evidence of colonial crimes.  \n",

      "Following up on the last update I provided about the work being conducted on the former Royal Victoria Hospital site, ground penetrating radar work was performed in priority areas of the site, as established  by the Settlement Agreement, a legally binding agreement we entered into last April with the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera, also known as the Mohawk Mothers, and the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI), which is responsible for redeveloping the site.\n",
      "The company conducting the work stated in a report summarizing its findings that no “likely” grave type features was identified across the site. However, “[i]n total, nine (9) geophysical signatures were identified across the site that display attributes allowing us to categorize them as “potential” grave type features.” These nine signatures are all outside the McGill project zone, which accounts for about 15 per cent of the entire site.\n",
      "The SQI indicated it will follow the recommendation of the Panel ofexpert archeologists, agreed to by all three parties, to investigate thenine areas manually. This technique will verify the results of theground penetrating radar, which cannot, on its own, confirm the presenceof graves. All archeological work is being conducted in the presence ofCultural Monitors named by the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera to ensureappropriate Indigenous protocols and ceremonies are respected.\n",
      "Meanwhile, discussions continue between the SQI, the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera and the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites, with respect to security on the site. This follows a reprehensible act last week, in which offensive remarks were directed at the Cultural Monitors as they were inappropriately asked to leave the site by a security guard. The SQI, which is responsible for security on the site, immediately condemned the action and dealt with the incident. Since then, discussions have been taking place to reach an agreement among the parties to put on additional security measures so that the archeological work at the site may resume as soon as possible.\n",

McGill refuses to follow the guidelines developed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and by archaeologists engaged in searching for unmarked graves since the first findings in Tk’emlúps in 2021. As stated by these, “any work to locate missing Indigenous children must be led by Indigenous communities.” The upcoming intervention at the Royal Victoria Hospital is not led by Indigenous people, but rather by development promoters and a private firm they hired. \n",
      "Since then, a temporary occupation by settler anarchists took place, the offices of Arkéos were vandalized by people claiming to act on behalf of the Mohawk Mothers (the action was condemned by the Mohawk Mothers and the solidarity committee), and a vigil by Divest McGill was held, surrounded by more police then there were citizens. Tensions are high in an extremely important case for Indigenous sovereignty on the island of Tiohtià:ke. The court hearing will be held on October 26, 2022, at the Montréal court. In order to better understand the situation, let us look back at the situation and how the tensions on Tiohtià:ke have built up since the Pope’s visit in July. \n",
      "Across territories of Indigenous Peoples in so-called Canada, the backlash of trauma was and continues to be felt by the express papal visit of July 24-29, 2022. Pope Francis' official apology was framed as an apology for the behavior of religious affiliates in residential schools without recognizing the church’s institutional role in cahoots with the federal government, which acted in a systematic manner, to undermine Indigenous ways of being. This common institutional strategy of blaming individual actors rather than taking responsibility for the core ideologies still salient in the church, and so many other institutions, only adds smoke to the smoke screens of an already aggravated political context of centuries of broken promises in a lingering colonial apparatus.  \n",
      "Despite the recognition of a \"cultural genocide\" by the Canadian authorities following the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Church still refuses to take responsibility for the consequences of the Catholic institution's genocidal mission in the public policies of Canadian federal state and provincial states colonial endeavors up to the 1990s, whose consequences are still very present. Faced with symbolic apologies and inaction, the reactions are mixed and many criticize the absence of responsibility or a work plan to “make things right”, as reported throughout the visit by APTN News.\n",
      "In Tiohtià:ke (Montréal), the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) held a press conference two days after the pope’s apology in Edmonton, at the foot of Tekanontak, under the continued smear of the Saint Jean Baptiste society’s cross overlooking the city of Montréal. This collective of Indigenous women from Kahnawa:ke – a Mohawk reserve on the south shore of Montréal – have been fighting for the recognition of unceded territories on and around the island of Tiohtià:ke for decades. They expressed their disbelief and feeling of emptiness following this apology. If the church and Pope Francis are “serious about making things right, [they] should start by revoking the Doctrine of Discovery”, said Kwetiio, spokesperson for the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera. \n",
      "Their demands were clear: there is a need for these institutions to recognize their ongoing ideological tenets and to take action to reverse the settlers' imposition of a colonial ecology. On the island of Tiohtià:ke, this means symbolically, taking down the cross which continually “remind us of the horrors that we have lived and that we have survived”, says Kahentinetha. It also means, on a structural level, questioning the current dismissal and appropriation of the island by private corporations like McGill University and its project to transform the former Royal Victoria Hospital into a New Vic modernized facility for “sustainable development and public policy research” with 50 000 square meters right on the south flank of mount Tekanontak. It is for this reason that the Kahnistensera have recently gone to court “in a bid to block the start of excavation work”(For more information, see the release of the affidavits by the Kahnistensera, here). \n",
      "The case of a city like Montréal based on the island of Tiohtià:ke is particularly relevant. The settlement of French colonizers on the island created the Eurocentric narrative of a transient Indigenous presence on the land, despite clear mapping and testimony of interactions over the centuries. It is understandable then that a cross raised high-up on the mount that once overlooked the multiple archeological sites of Indigenous villages continues to upset the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera that ask for its removal as survivors of residential schools. \n",
      "When one starts digging, the veneer always scratches off from the surface with ease to reveal the underlying structure. The narrative of an abandoned island, and a cross that only testifies of settler perseverance and not colonial imposition of christianity, is yet again a direct attempt to forget the complex history of permanent presence, negotiations, warfare, and partial destruction of Indigenous Peoples.\n",
      "If one initiates a forensic study of the archeology and architectural development of Montréal as a city on the island of Tiohtià:ke, one finds a completely different story. Affirming the absence of Indigenous people or Mohawk lineage on the island of Tiohtià:ke, is (i) a direct refusal to acknowledge the worldview and oral knowledge of the Mohawk people and the history of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy, and (ii) a willful ignorance of the complexity of continued warfare, epidemics and movements of Indigenous populations occurring during the centuries of colonization in the midst of which Chomedey de Maisonneuve founded the city of Montréal.\n",
      "The Rotinonshón:ni’s cosmology refutes ownership of land as they consider that “we belong to the earth” in the same way as “we belong to our mother.” “The feminine principle having, in matrilinear Peoples, an intrinsic link to land”. This definition of humans as linked and belonging to the earth also breaks the ethnic lineage to one of specific characteristics of a land and of a way of living on it, i.e., the logics through which we inhabit a given land (the definition of ecology – eko (habitat), logos (logic)). The very nature of lineage is therefore completely different as it is based on an ethical belonging that is transcribed both in the characteristics of a land but also in the animal’s spirit to which one belongs in a clan. This explains in great part the fragmented and extremely mobile networks that constitute Indigenous Peoples’ way of life on Turtle Island and their mixing beyond “national” belonging that revokes the modern conception of communitarian enclosure associated with birth (Natio) blood rights on a given territory.\n",
      "In ignoring this oral history, the compressed Mohawk’s claim now needs to justify its political and legal arguments under the requirements of the settler’s ecology. Such refusal to recognize the other’s ecology documents the history of Montréal and Québec’s modern foundations. For many decades, Québec nationalism considered itself a victim of the British colonizers, and ever since built its relation to the land and Indigenous people through the invisibilisation of their struggle: the Indigenous were the federal government’s affair and not the real victims of colonization, as the Québecois considered themselves a minority overwhelmed and conquered by the Anglo-Saxon majority.\n",
      "The separatist and nationalist movement was confronted to this contradiction when it took the path, following decades of fragmentary resistance through the Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ), of “converting their separatism into sovereignism” in the wake of the 1970s economic crisis. Abandoning the fragmented minority of its initial separatist struggle, the Québec nationalism grew into a majoritarian ambition of achieving “logistico-institutional” independence by “conquering the forces of nature.” These numerous development projects were instrumental in the blackmailing and invisibilisation of Indigenous communities and their ways of life.\n",
      "Finally, observing the developmental blackmailing in the upsurge of Québec’s national industrialization can help us to better understand Montréal’s modernization process. The documentary Main basse sur la ville reveals how during the 1970s, Montréal’s historical neighborhoods were destroyed with just as little care or consideration as for original archeological testimonies of Indigenous presence. Through the accumulated wealth stolen from the colonized African countries, Montréal’s skyscrapers were being built by the same European financiers and State funded colonial corporations that were ravaging the world economically and ecologically.\n",
      "The development of Montréal in the 1970s was never intended to ameliorate the lives of the citizens of settler societies, let alone that of Indigenous Peoples parked in reserves nearby. The constant speculation on land to perpetuate the expansion of an unlivable way of life is still a financial game in the hands of a few families in Montréal. A concrete prison continues to be raised, drowning the history of the island.\n",
      "The New Vic Project is a perfect representation of a refusal from the public and private institutional powers to re-think the model on which they stand in the settler metropolis of Montréal. The institution of McGill, founded by a fur trader turned land speculator and slave owner, Montréal’s richest citizen, holds an endowment of $1,892 billion (as of April 30, 2021), and its wealthy industrial donors and fossil fuel-friendly board members continue to finance an economy that keeps refusing any space for Indigenous ecologies and perpetuates the extractivist denial of settler societies.\n",
      "The validation of the New Vic project as part of the Québec government’s $787 million financing for renovation of post-secondary educational institutions, stands firm in the tradition of developmental blackmail. Despite claiming in the seven directing principles of the project that it will “recognize the Indigenous past [and not the present] of the New Vic location and honor it” (as a fifth principle), the project reasserts the hegemony of the settler ecology on the land of Indigenous Peoples by claiming as a first and foremost principle that it is a project “for Montréal, Québec and Canada”, not the Indigenous. Its research program focuses on building a “unique expertise in science and engineering for sustainable development with the humanities and public policy making, to turn knowledge into action.”\n",
      "Not once does it give way to actual Indigenous knowledge or ways of life, to considering their seminal and historical importance in the preservation of a liveable and sustainable environment on the island of Tiohtià:ke, Kanien’kehá:ka land and so-called Canada. The full hypocrisy of the veneer of reconciliation is at work in every page of the New Vic project and its public announcements. From superficial acknowledgment statements, to promises of “respectful relations to Indigenous Peoples” and embedding “Indigenous themes'' in the project, the message is clear: Indigenous presence is a past motif that only merits to adorn the walls of a brand new development project as memories of a bygone era. In this way, we move from firsting to lasting.\n",
      "If the New Vic project truly aimed at tackling “the biggest issues of our time by thinking outside the box” in the words of principal and vice-chancellor Suzanne Fortier, then let us propose a series of concrete Indigenous knowledge that turns directly into action. We need solutions that can fulfill the publicly acknowledged need for serious reconciliation and reparation of our Peoples. \n",
      "Building on the Indigenous ecology we have described along the way, we can imagine how reparations can truly be enacted in this particular context. As settler societies only begin to accept the persistent existence of the “other” – those ungovernable and fragmented Peoples that do not own this land but are a part of it – a shift needs to occur to allow for a middle ground to exist. If settlers – once migrants, before clouding their minds with illusions of discovery, ownership, and destiny upon this land – accept to listen and give living space to other ecologies, then perhaps the successive betrayals of the past treaties can be overcome and the twofold-cheater attitude rejected and condemned.\n",
      "To do so one must first cease to systematically force the “other” into one’s own intellectual framework. This can only be accomplished if we are willing to make things right by returning lands and listening to legitimate calls from Indigenous Peoples to return great parts of the territory we claim to own, back to their traditional ways. \n",
      "Returning back to traditional ways means to reinstate a value system that measures the wealth of a given community according to the health of its habitat, and the success of its members by the solidity of the relations nurtured within the community and living beings of our environment. The words of Tekarontakeh a kanien’kehá:ka Elder during the book launch of the Mohawk Warrior Society: A Handbook on Sovereignty and Survival strengthens this statement, and what is at the heart of reclaiming Indigenous ways of life: \n",
      "“We did not make citizens of anyone, we made you equals and this is what should be taking place around the world. It should not be, small groups of people to decide. This is why we have been fighting, we know about that way of life, we know about these teachings, we continue to adhere to it in the best way we can, but we are constantly being oppressed, we are constantly having this genocide committed.\"\n",
      "What is being asked here, is to reclaim, that is “to reappropriate or rehabilitate something that has been partially lost, or denied so as to be modified by this new learning.” At the heart of Tiohtià:ke this can be accomplished if we listen to the demands of the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera. As clan mothers, they hold through the Woman nomination belt (Ka’shastnsera Kontihwe Ne Iotiian:shon) a responsibility on unceded territory that forms a legitimate legal and political claim on Tiohtià:ke.\n",
      "Hence, in solidarity with the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera and following some of their long-running demands, we offer as a committee a series of short and long-term proposals to overcome the settler’s ecology embedded in the New Vic project and to call for action to implement a project that truly responds to the need of making things right. This can only be a first step towards actions and means to reinstate a way of life embedded in the kanien’kehá:ka land on which Montréal currently resides. \n",
      "If we are to act according to our words and respect the original agreements on which Indigenous Peoples, specifically of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy in the case of Tiohtià:ke, welcomed us on Anowarà:ke (Turtle island), then we must first and foremost consider how to rehabilitate the Tehiohate (Two Row Wampum), the Rotinonshón:ni protocol and alliance belt for relationships with settlers. \n",
      "This agreement, first made with the Dutch settlers, then the English and French, helps understand the agreement under which migrants have been welcomed onto this land: as ships on a river we are to move and live side by side as communities to “remain parallel” and refrain from crossing on the other’s way of life. As Philippe Blouin explains: “This paradoxical conception of alliance through separation not only applies to relationships with settlers, but between any and all social groups, including non-human nations, ensuring their mutual respect in diplomacy.”\n",
      "On the island of Tiohtià:ke and its surroundings, this would signify a way of renegotiating land on a colonized space to give back parts of the island to an Indigenous presence that could form a networked ecology of non-sedentary paths from Kahnawa:ke to Tekanontak, to Kahneseta:ke and beyond. Such a renegotiation would reinstate the row of Indigenous land and the eastern gate of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy. \n",
      "Removing the cross from Tekanontak, returning the mount to kanien’kehá:ka care, and enacting land heritage out of the dispossessions made by theft would be a first step. The next would be to conceive of new legal, economic, and social checks and balances for a two row development of ways of life on the territory, from Montréal to Québec, to Canada giving way to a two-sided land with equal territories for Tiohtià:ke, Rotinonshón:ni and Indigenous Peoples in general.\n",
      "To do this, however, we must begin locally by researching how one may reconsider urbanity, institutions, and territory beyond the sole imposition of a settler’s ecology.\n",
      "The most urgent local demands arise from the twofold cheater’s trap of a project like the New Vic. If McGill truly wished to implicate and acknowledge Indigenous land then they would follow consequential proposals such as these: \n",
      "A first short term response would be to help conduct a full external enquiry on the grounds of the Allan Memorial Institute and the Royal Victoria Hospital. This investigation using forensic tools such as those proposed by Forensic Architecture, would study the allegations of unmarked graves and of multiple archeological sites presumed to be there by the Arkeos report. \n",
      "A second short-term response would be to establish, under the initiative of the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera, a longhouse location to serve as an archival and cultural center in the tradition of the Rotinonshón:ni confederacy. If the cross is removed, mount Tekanontak could become a key part of the process of making things right here on the island of Tiohtià:ke. \n",
      "On a more long-term approach, if McGill were to accept a real external enquiry and give the land back to a “public domain” entrusted to kanien’kehá:ka people in order to set up an architectural project based on the guidance of archeological research established during the public consultation, McGill would finally “anchor” its project into the collectivity whilst reconciling with the Indigenous people that it systematically ignores when it states that it wishes to interact with the collectivity of “neighbors, Montréalers, Québécois, and Canadians”, failing once again to identify the presence of kanien’kehá:ka Peoples, despite acknowledging it was their land a few pages earlier.\n",
      "The reality is that private institutions like McGill as much as public ones like the city of Montréal, still do not wish to consider their role to make things right as one of actual actions in reparation. Real long-term solutions, like giving research funds and land, currently owned and managed by McGill to kanien’kehá:ka people to transform the worded desires of “acknowledgment and reconciliation” into concrete actions, keeps on never occurring. The hypocrisy of the extractivist denial is more salient than ever in the attitudes and proposals of the New Vic project and the way McGill as much as the public institutions have handled it.\n",
      " On this island of passage, where Indigenous nomads, migrant workers, and wandering souls have resided, and where in the past, smoke signals regularly informed the surrounding Rotinonshón:ni territories with news from the eastern gate, a signal was sent to all the Peoples of Anowarà:ke (Turtle Island). To remind those who woefully forget, that the irresolution of unceded lands on the island of Tiohtià:ke and its surroundings cannot be ignored. Action to restore ways of life that coincide once more with the earth and the two row wampum to which us settlers gave our word only to betray it, must take place once more to find a way out of a society that has passed the point of no return in climate doom and ecological collapse.  \n",

      "Kahentinetha, a Kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk Mother) of the Bear Clan and founder of Mohawk Nation News, is demanding the suspension of McGill’s New Vic project. In a brief posted to the Mohawk Nation News website, Kahentinetha called on McGill to acknowledge Indigenous sovereignty and to allow an investigation team—comprised of a surveyor, geologist, search dog, all guided by GeoView Pro software—to search for unmarked graves she suspects may be on the project site.\n",
      "In the Mohawk Nation News post, Kahentinetha argued that because the Royal Victoria Hospital site sits on unceded Kanien’kehá:ka territory, the kaia’nere:kowa (The Great Law of Peace), pre-colonial Mohawk law,  applies. Under this law, the Kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera are caretakers of the land, and all decisions regarding it must be made with their consent. Additionally, Kahentinetha claimed that the Canadian government held money from the Iroquois Trust Fund, loaned it to McGill Universityin 1847, and never paid it back. \n",
      "According to a McGill media relations officer Frédérique Mazerolle, McGill’s Indigenous Initiatives Unit and the Indigenous-owned consulting firm Acosys aimed to include Indigenous peoples in producing the project’s design.\n",
      "“There have been several exchanges, including information sessions and round table discussions with Indigenous education organizations, Mohawk alumni, and Elders,” Mazerolle wrote in an email to The McGill Tribune. \n",
      "In an interview with the Tribune, Kahentinetha argued that the land should be treated as an archeological site until further investigations are completed.\n",
      "“[Rumours of unmarked graves on the property] are becoming more and more serious, so we would like that investigated,” Kahentinetha said. “And certainly there are our people buried up there in pre-colonial times, and we want that investigated as well. Nothing can proceed until that is done [….] If there’s going to be any investigation, we want to be involved with that. We want it done to our satisfaction.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha believes McGill’s exchanges with Indigenous peoples should go beyond discussions with select community representatives, and should instead look to gain the consent of each member of the community, according to structures of Indigenous law.\n",
      "“I do not think any one of [the Indigenous groups and representatives consulted] lives by the Great Peace,” Kahentinetha said. “We do not want consultation. You have to get our permission, and our permission we get from the Great Law [….] Each one of us has to have a say in whatever the decision is. Each one of us. Nobody speaks for us.”\n",
      "In the 1950s and 60s, Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron experimented with torture techniques at the Allan Memorial Institute, a former psychiatric hospital next to the old Royal Victoria building. One Mohawk Nation News article features an interview with Lana Ponting, a survivor of these experiments, who says, “I am convinced that there are bodies buried in the property in the interview [….] I was really concerned about Indigenous peoples. I firmly believe that some of them were in the Allan.”\n",
      "Kahentinetha, too, wants to send a forensic and archeological team to search for the bodies of potential Indigenous and non-Indigenous victims of Cameron’s experiments.\n",
      "Public consultation on the New Vic project is ongoing. The rotisken’raketeh (Men’s Council Fire) will present Kahentinetha’s brief to the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) on Nov. 10.\n",
      "Mazerolle did not specify whether McGill would change the direction of the project to investigate human remains, pointing to prior studies conducted onsite.\n",
      "“McGill commissioned a study on the archeological potential of the Royal Victoria Hospital site in 2016,” Mazerolle wrote. “According to this study, it is unlikely that Indigenous remains will be found on the New Vic Project site. However, McGill remains committed to collaborating with the government and First Nations communities regarding potential vestiges. Should such vestiges be found, it will be made public immediately, the work will be suspended, and an archaeological officer of the Minister of Culture and Communications will be alerted (as stated in the Cultural Heritage Act.1).”\n",
      "While the study Mazerolle references determined that pre-colonial Indigenous settlement on the project site was unlikely, it also states there is no way to confidently know whether it was a burial site, unless human remains are found.\n",

In addition, Indigenous children were being torn from their families as part of the Sixties Scoop. Beginning in the mid 1950s, child welfare officials “scooped up” Indigenous children, placed them in foster homes, or had them adopted out into white families. State policies contributed to lasting familial trauma.\n",

      "After a triumph in court against some of Quebec and Canada’s biggest institutional bodies, the Kanien’kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) are now taking on another political fight, this time in regards to Montreal’s Irish Famine Monument Park, which sits atop a cemetery that the group says houses Indigenous ancestors. \n",
      "Recently, the remains of more than a dozen individuals were removed to insert a pylon for the new Reseau express metropolitain (REM) train system, leading to growing concerns about future developments at the site\n",
      "The group is calling for a leadership review of the Irish Monument Park Foundation, whose mission is to honour victims of the Irish famine, to ensure proper decisions are made at a site they say could house Indigenous graves.\n",
      "“If the public were to understand what happened, they’d be appalled,” said Kwetiio, who is one of the Kahnistensera. “It’s covering up things that shouldn’t be covered up. This burial site needs to be memorialized, not dug into.”\n",
      "The Irish Famine Monument Park is home to the Black Rock, a large boulder that marks a cemetery where Irish famine refugees who died of typhus in 1847 are buried. It’s also believed that non-Irish ancestors, including Indigenous and Black ancestors, may be buried at the site.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera were first approached about this issue earlier this year by historian Donovan King. King first started work with the Irish Monument Park Foundation in 2014 with a walking tour and blog posts explaining the history of the site. He explained that he’s since grown concerned about the foundation’s leadership, with one of the directors, Fergus Keyes, raising what King said are alarming ideas. \n",
      "When a petition circulated to remove a statue of John A. Macdonald, Canada’s first prime minister who was responsible for the forced removal of Indigenous people from their lands, Keyes launched a counter petition, which was advertised on the foundation’s Facebook group. The petition, which shows publicly was started by Keyes, is still live. \n",
      "“I studied John A. Macdonald for 50 years, so I have a pretty good handle on who he was and what he did in his 50 years of political contributions to the country. I mean, when it comes to the First Nations, there’s definitely problems, but I think that might be cherry picking his entire legacy, which is quite broad,” Keyes said in an interview with THE EASTERN DOOR. \n",
      "“I think he may be slightly misunderstood by the public. You’re talking about a specific situation, but I don’t think that overcomes his entire 50 years of building the country and building the foundation.”\n",
      "Keyes said he did not post the petition in the foundation’s Facebook group. He called accusations by King of sentiments of racism by the petition’s signatories “a disgusting accusation.”\n",
      "“I’m certainly not a racist by any shape or form. It’s ridiculous. It’s a silly and ridiculous accusation that bears no resemblance to reality,” he said. \n",
      "Comments on the petition include direct references to Macdonald’s treatment of Indigenous people.\n",
      "“One of Sir John’s perceived crimes was educating the aboriginals (sic). At the time they lived in small communities outside of the main hub… The natives were having a difficult time communicating with the Europeans and the number was growing. How was he to dictate them and not continue the isolation? I would like someone to come up with a better solution,” one comment read.\n",
      "When asked if he would support the Mothers’ request for a leadership review, Keyes said he was unsure what their position was on the matter and that there had already been a blessing at the rock with a Catholic bishop, an Anglican bishop, a rabbi, and faithkeeper Ka’nahsohon Kevin Deer.\n",
      "“Kevin Deer blessed the site in the Mohawk language as well as the other participants,” he said. “There was never the slightest controversy concerning this excavation.”\n",
      "King maintains that Keyes’ role in the foundation is at odds with the ongoing project of reconciliation.\n",
      "“It’s weird because some people in the community who are Irish diasporans kind of gloss over the colonialism because now they’re beneficiaries of it,” King said. “Now they’re saying, ‘Oh, Canada’s the best country in the world,’ but they don’t understand that it only is for them, and it’s at the expense of Indigenous people. It’s a historical ignorance.”\n",
      "For the Mothers, this kind of sentiment in leadership of a site that could contain Indigenous graves is concerning. They are supporting King in demanding a leadership review to identify what players in the foundation’s leadership may be standing in the way of protecting Indigenous and Irish graves.\n",
      "“It irked me that someone who was a person on the board was using the platform to promote (keeping the John A. Macdonald statue), because it’s contrary to our people, and it’s racist,” Kwetiio said. “Everything else I expected, but I didn’t expect the person who’s (involved in) the foundation to want that.”\n",
      "The Mothers fear that without a leadership review, the site will be threatened with desecration by the construction of the REM train and other corporate projects. As caretakers of the land, they said the projects cannot go ahead without their consent.\n",
      "“It’s a big no-no to be profiting off someone’s burial ground, and it also shouldn’t be destroyed in the first place,” Kwetiio said. \n",

      "The Mohawk Mothers, also known as the Kahnistensera, will hold a press conference at the corner of avenue des Pins and Doctor Penfield on September 12, 2023, at 2:30pm.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera filed an Emergency Motion to halt drilling and excavation at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, which will be heard on Thursday September 14 at the Superior Court in Montreal. The Emergency Motion details breaches to the Settlement Agreement by McGIll and the SQI that the Mohawk Mothers repeatedly raised in direct talks about significant concerns with the way they are handling the archaeological investigation ordered by the Quebec Superior Court to search for unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera are shocked and disappointed that McGill University and the Société Québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) have pressed ahead with construction on September 11, 2023 by drilling a large number of holes marking the beginning of a series of excavations.\n",
      "The same day, McGill University issued a message to all its staff and students, declaring that the investigation of the zone where they want to start work is complete, and produced no evidence of graves. The Mohawk Mothers see these developments as major provocations, as the investigation is far from complete and McGill’s messaging predominantly emphasizes favourable findings while concurrently concealing or downplaying several discoveries that confirm the possibility of unmarked burials at the New Vic site. These discoveries require further follow-up to determine whether the New Vic development work can safely proceed.\n",
      "On August 29, 2023, the Mohawk Mothers filed a motion for a safeguard order to enforce the settlement agreement signed by all parties in April 2023, after a landmark injunction stopping work in October 2023. The Kahnistensera flagged several breaches to the letter and the spirit of the settlement agreement, after McGill and SQI disbanded the panel of three archaeologist experts agreed upon by all parties to make recommendations.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera’s court files show that McGill and the SQI refused to follow several recommendations from the archaeologists, such as sifting the soil of areas where anomalies of potential bodies were located. Court documents also reveal that the SQI refused to share data from Ground Penetrating Radar with the Canadian Archaeology Association and the panel of experts itself, and silenced numerous “unknown” anomalies that the GPR report say could possibly be graves of children or without coffins in public communications. Several artifacts, including a dress, children’s shoes and bones excavated in a zone where search dogs detected the scent of human remains have not yet been examined by experts, and the origin of the scent of human remains picked up by search dogs has not been established.\n",
      "According to the Kahnistensera, SQI and McGill have refused to allow the search dogs to return to the site to sniff the piles of soil that were excavated or determine whether the smell came from inside the building, where archaeologists were denied access. “Since the Panel was disbanded, McGill and SQI have basically decided to take over the whole investigation, even though they have been opposed to it even happening from the start,” said Kwetiio, a Mohawk Mother. “I don’t understand how it is even possible that they can act that way when a Court Order determined that this would be a Indigenous-led”, she said, “And there was just a little extra effort to do this the right way and provide closure to survivors and the families. We had gone such a long way with everything that happened.”\n",
      "During three weeks the work had stopped after the Mohawk Mothers and Cultural Monitors were attacked by security guards working for the SQI on July 25th. The guards had assaulted someone present to take his phone to erase a video, while someone else recorded racist insults telling the Mohawk elders to “go make some children” and “find a life.”\n",
      "According to Kahentinetha, “on September 11 we saw the two same security guards on the archaeological site, even though the SQI told us they had been removed”. Even though the settlement agreement allowed Indigenous cultural monitors to be on the site and monitor the work, Kahentinetha, 84 years old, says they now fear for their safety. “The security guards that attacked us are still there, and now they want to rush in large-scale excavation for their New Vic project. In fact they drilled those holes yesterday without us being present. They didn’t even give us a safety training for working in zones under construction with heavy machinery, and we don’t have the proper equipment. The settlement agreement said we have to be there, but it’s extremely dangerous in these conditions.” The Kahnistensera also indicated that violations of construction safety regulations were already flagged, as masonry material stacked higher than 1.8 meters next to an unsanitary toilet cultural monitors were expected to use. “Are we still being treated like animals, like a problem to get rid of, in the heart of Montreal, where the village of our ancestors sits,” said Kahentinetha. “But we will not take genocide anymore, both Canadian and Mohawk law agree on this,” she said.\n",
      "The Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) is a Kahnawake-based group that helps Indigenous women accomplish their traditional cultural duty as caretakers of the land, to protect all life, including their children and ancestors. They have been engaged in a legal challenge with promoters of the New Vic project to stall future excavation of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site until a proper archaeological investigation is conducted, using the traditional protocols of the Kaianere'kó:wa (Great Peace)\n",

      "In Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) language, Kahnistensera means “life givers.” It alludes to the umbilical cord that attaches all women to Mother Earth. \n",
      "According to Kaianerehkó:wa, the Great Law of Peace, the Kahnistensera are the “Progenitors of the Nation. They shall own the land and the soil.” Women are thus caretakers of the land, it is our cultural duty to protect all life, including our children and ancestors. This was our position as Plaintiffs before the Superior Court of Quebec. \n",
      "As caretakers of the land, we see it as our inherent duty to ensure that allegations of undiscovered evidence and unmarked graves are considered with the respect, gravity and cultural sensitivity that they deserve. \n",
      "In June 2022, Kanien’kehá :ka lawyer, Kimberly Murray, was appointed the Independent Special Interlocutor for Missing Children and Unmarked Graves and Burial Sites associated with Indian Residential Schools. The purpose of Murray’s position is to “work closely and collaboratively with Indigenous leaders, communities, Survivors, families and experts to identify needed measures and recommend a new federal legal framework to ensure the respectful and culturally appropriate treatment and protection of unmarked graves and burial sites of children at former residential schools.” \n",
      "Murray’s office is also tasked with highlighting the connections between Residential Schools and other institutions which may also contain unmarked graves, including sanatoriums, hospitals, and detention centers.  \n",
      "Representing Kimberly Murray’s office, lawyers Julian Falconer and Donald Worme intervened in the Mohawk Mothers’ court case, offering expertise and guidance to Justice Gregory Moore. \n",
      "Lawyers representing this Office played a significant role in the October 2022 Mohawk Mothers’ injunction audience against the New Vic.\n",
      "One of the oldest universities in Canada, McGill University is named after James McGill, a wealthy fur trader and slave owner whose statue was toppled by activists in 2021. McGill’s controversial  links with military research have scandalized the public on several occasions. The university’s psychiatric department became the central hub of the CIA’s unethical psychiatric experiments in the 1950 and 1960s. \n",
      "In 2018, the Government of Quebec authorized McGill University to prepare an Opportunity Study; it looked at repurposing part of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site. Since then, Quebec has mandated Pierre Major to lead the New Vic project and transform part of the Royal Victoria Hospital into a new campus. \n",
      "Promoter of New Vic project, the SQI was established by the Government of Quebec in 2013. Its mission is to support public bodies “in the management of their public infrastructure projects by ensuring rigorous planning, implementation and monitoring of projects.” In 2018, the SQI was mandated by the Government of Quebec to create a Master Plan for the repurposing of the Royal Victoria Hospital site. \n",
      "Know History has been contracted by the Mohawk Mothers to conduct archival research and statement gathering. This work will support the archaeological investigation into the presence of unmarked graves on the site of the New Vic Project. \n",
      "Know History is a historical research firm trusted by Indigenous groups and governments across Canada to accurately and respectfully research, document, and share their stories.  \n",
      "Under Quebec’s Cultural Heritage Act, the City of Montreal is responsible for preserving the Mount-Royal Patrimonial Site, and the Royal Victoria Hospital buildings. \n",
      "The aim of the Cultural Heritage Act is to “promote, in the public interest and from a sustainable development perspective, the knowledge, protection, enhancement and transmission of cultural heritage, which is a reflection of a society’s identity. It is also intended to promote the designation of deceased persons of historical importance and historic events and sites.” \n",
      "Mount Royal’s designation as a Historic and Natural District reflects a desire on behalf of government to preserve the many historical sites and monuments located in the historic territory. Mount Royal includes Mount Royal Park, religious sites and monuments, and burial sites for Indigenous and European-Quebecois populations. \n",
      "Band councils were imposed on Indigenous Peoples through the Indian Act. Following a Canadian political structure—including the election of band councils by band members—it is a governance model that is largely incompatible with indigenous political organizations and values. As stated in the Haudenosaunee Position Paper, presented to the United Nations in 197, Band Councils are “political colonies among Native peoples.” \n",
      "As traditional Longhouse Kanien'kehá:ka women, the Mohawk Mothers follow  the Kaianerehkó:wa, a precolonial constitution which is based on consensual decision-making and harmony between clans, genders, and peoples. According to the Kaianerehkó:wa, the Kahnistensera (women, life-givers) are the “progenitors of the soil.” We are in charge of selecting speakers for our people, and of caretaking the land and all children of the past, present and future generations. \n",
      "The Government of Canada, as with all levels of government, plays an important role in Canada’s journey towards reconciliation.  \n",
      "As one of the Calls to Action outlined in the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report, the commission called upon the federal government to “work with provincial, territorial, and municipal governments, churches, Aboriginal communities, former residential school students, and current landowners to develop and implement strategies and procedures for the ongoing identification, documentation, maintenance, commemoration, and protection of residential school cemeteries or other sites at which residential school children were buried. This is to include the provision of appropriate memorial ceremonies and commemorative markers to honour the deceased children.” As per Article 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, Canada respects the ancestral and treaty rights of Indigenous Peoples. Over the last decades, Canada has publicly repeated its commitment to efforts with Indigenous Peoples, and more recently, to applying the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations. Nevertheless, when called to Court by Indigenous peoples, including the Mohawk Mothers, Canada generally fights them. \n",
      "The Canadian Government has acknowledged that the residential school system amounted to a cultural genocide of Indigenous Peoples, for the systemic mistreatment of Indigenous peoples in institutions such as Residential Schools, hospitals, and detention centers. Indigenous peoples were exposed to a range of horrific abuse, all within systems aimed at killing “the Indian in the child.” \n",
      "The admission of genocide makes it necessary to examine Canada’s legal framework to ensure that future legislative changes will protect Indigenous peoples from crimes against humanity on their homeland. In accordance with Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people (UNDRIP), Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain their ancestral and treaty rights on their traditional territories. The Rotinonshonni (Iroquois) Confederacy has a longstanding treaty relationship with European settlers, reflected in the Tehiohate (Two Row Wampum), and the Silver Covenant Chain, which state that Indigenous and settler ways of life can live together on the condition that they do not encroach upon one another. According to its Constitution, Canada respects the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples on their territory, Anowarekeh (Turtle Island). \n",

      "Montreal's public consultation office is recommending that McGill University's plans to redevelop part of the former Royal Victoria Hospital move forward, but not without some key changes. \n",
      "A report released Tuesday by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) outlined 31 recommendations for the $700-million project to transform part of the hospital into an academic centre.\n",
      "Overall, the OCPM is in favour of the plan, but its report takes into account concerns that the redevelopment could hinder efforts to find unmarked graves of Indigenous children on the old hospital's grounds.\n",
      "In March, a group of women called the Mohawk Mothers filed a civil suit in the Superior Court of Quebec demanding the suspension of the redevelopment plans for the former hospital pending an investigation into that possibility. Their claim will be heard in court next week. \n",
      "They believe the site may house archeological remains from the first pre-colonial Iroquois village.\n",
      "They also believe, based on testimony, that there may be Indigenous children buried near the Allan Memorial Institute following CIA-funded brainwashing experiments conducted by Dr. Ewan Cameron between 1954 and 1963.\n",
      "The OCPM says those claims should be investigated and the process should be made public.\n",
      "\"[Regarding] the possible presence of some ancient or more recent burials, for the commission it's very important that it's treated with the utmost respect and deference,\" said Isabelle Beaulieu, president of the OCPM.\n",
      "The report also urges McGill to relinquish the natural space and wooded area north of the hospital in order to integrate it within Mount Royal Park.\n",
      "Beaulieu says there's a \"very big attachment\" to the mountain and to the heritage of the Royal Vic site. \n",
      "That's why her report says the preservation of that heritage must be part of the project, which means maintaining heritage buildings and not adding new office towers that would hinder views to the mountain. \n",
      "The OCPM also recommends that the city keeps using the site as a shelter until the downtown homeless shelters satisfy the demand.\n",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Royal Vic was converted into a temporary refuge for people experiencing homelessness.\n",
      "The OCPM presented its recommendations to Montreal's city council. The council would need to approve two key zoning changes in order for the project to become a reality.\n",
      "The university is looking to begin demolition and decontamination in 2023. Project completion is set for 2028. More than 2,400 people participated in the public consultation, which took place last fall.\n",

      "On October 27, 2022, the Mohawk Mothers won an important battle: the first-ever injunction obtained by self-represented Indigenous peoples in a Canadian Court. Following their own Indigenous legal system, the Kaianerehkó:wa, the Mohawk Mothers reminded the Quebec Superior Court of their obligations vis-à-vis Indigenous peoples and called upon the Court to respect their own laws protecting Indigenous peoples from mistreatment, including extermination policies. In court, the Mohawk Mothers faced numerous adversaries, including top lawyers from McGill University, the Société Québécoise des Infrastructures (SQI), the McGill University Health Center (MUHC), the Royal Victoria Hospital, the City of Montreal, the Attorney General of Canada, and the Attorney General of Quebec.\n",
      "The injunction issued by Justice Gregory Moore was issued on the basis of the plaintiffs’ (Mohawk Mothers) concerns that Indigenous children were used as test subjects in medical experiments at the Royal Victoria Hospital, and were potentially buried on the site slated for redevelopment. These concerns were based on both archival evidence and witness accounts, including a first-hand account of Lana Ponting, 81, a survivor of the CIA-funded MKULTRA mind control experiments. The Mohawk Mothers argued that the land set for redevelopment was the site of the precolonial Iroquoian village of Tekanontak (Mount Royal) and was used as a burial site before the arrival of Europeans. The necessity of using appropriate archaeological means to preserve the history of Iroquoian peoples cannot be a topic of debate.\n",
      "Throughout the hearings on October 26th and 27th, defendants and promoters of the redevelopment project used an array of technical and legal arguments to convey the following:\n",
      "That the plaintiffs were using the wrong forum to lay their claims, as other administrative processes exist for such questions in the province of Québec;\n",
      "That the promoters have not broken any law(s) and are respecting the Quebec Heritage Act (the plaintiffs asked that the Act be declared unconstitutional because it considers Indigenous heritage as the property of Quebec);\n",
      "That most of the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, the Special Interlocutor, as well as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report, was not eligible for technical reasons; and\n",
      "That the six plaintiffs did not represent the Mohawk people –(the Mohawk Mothers argued that in Indigenous culture, every individual is free and self-representing)\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers emphasized that it was their cultural duty to act as caretakers of their traditional territory, and to protect the children of past, present, and future generations. We also argued that allowing excavation work on the site could cause irreparable harm to the identity, history, and trust of Indigenous peoples. We emphasized that the situation was urgent: shovels had already broken ground just two days before the hearings. \n",
      "The Court Ruling acknowledged that the balance of convenience favored the Mohawk Mothers, who would “suffer irreparable harm if the excavation work is not suspended for the time it takes to develop an appropriate archaeological plan to identify any unmarked graves,” following the best practices determined by the Canadian Archaeological Association. The ruling thus invited the parties to “speak out of court to settle their differences on an amicable basis.” The promoters were reminded of Call to Action number 76 (found in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report), which relates to missing children and burial information:\n",
      "The Indigenous community most affected shall lead the development of the investigation;\n",
      "Input must be sought from Survivors and Knowledge Keepers in developing those strategies;\n",
      "Indigenous protocols shall be respected before any invasive technical inspection and investigation of a cemetery site. \n",
      "The ruling also ordered the defendants to fund the investigation. \n",
      "Following the injunction that was obtained on October 27, 2022, the Mohawk Mothers participated in negotiations with McGill University and the SQI to develop an archaeological plan for the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital. A series of Judicial Settlement Conferences led all parties to adopt a settlement agreement which was homologated by the Quebec Superior Court and made public and enforceable on April 20, 2023.\n",
      "The agreement, signed by the Mohawk Mothers, McGill University, the McGill University Health Center, the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of Quebec, and the City of Montreal, provides that a panel of three archaeologists jointly selected by all parties will make recommendations for remote-sensing techniques that will ensure that no remains are destroyed or disturbed during excavation work. These techniques include Ground Penetrant Radar, search dogs, and LiDAR laser imaging. The panel’s recommendations will be binding to all parties. Cultural monitors, appointed by the Mohawk Mothers, will be present during the execution of the techniques to conduct appropriate ceremonies and to ensure that Indigenous protocols regarding burial sites are respected at all times. \n",
      "In addition, McGill University, the McGill University Health Center, and the Attorney General of Canada have committed to sharing archival materials under their custody that may be of assistance in locating unmarked graves, or which may provide information on the medical experiments that were conducted at the hospital. These materials will be gathered and studied by the historical research firm, Know History, with funding provided by Canada. A process for gathering the statements of survivors is also being initiated.\n",
      "A preliminary investigation, spearheaded by the Mohawk Mothers since 2021, has led to several findings currently being examined with the help of archivists and historians. In an affidavit sharing the results of the preliminary investigation, and supported by 141 exhibits, anthropologist Philippe Blouin outlined evidence supporting the claim that the Royal Victoria Hospital site may hide unmarked Indigenous graves.\n",
      "As the assimilation of Indigenous people was being carried out as part of the Residential School system Indigenous children were being sent to other disciplinary institutions as well, such as psychiatric wards, juvenile delinquency centers, correction homes, and reformatories. Through IQ tests, juvenile courts, Indian agents, as well as the health care system and military institutions, Indigenous and Inuit people were brought to the Royal Victoria Hospital where they were subjected to medical experiments.\n",
      "Currently, more than 130 Indigenous children have been reported missing after being treated in Quebec hospitals since the 1950s. There are likely many more: the names of many children were not recorded, as they had been taken from their families and deemed orphans. \n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers’ investigation aims to find all the children that have disappeared, using the best practices to do so, and to offer closure to the families by disclosing the full story of how they went missing.\n",

      "Kahentinetha, who is part of the group and a member of the Bear Clan in Kahnawà:ke, said when the decision was read, a lawyer turned around to tell her that she had just made history. \n",
      "\"We were so excited. We couldn't even understand what had happened,\" said Kahentinetha, whose group has been demanding the suspension of the redevelopment plans for the past year. She said the win signifies dignity for her people. \n",
      "\"It maybe represents that this whole issue of the genocide that happened to us, which has been pushed under the rug, is going to come back out now, because now we have the means,\" said Kahentinetha.\n",
      "Kimberly Murray, a federally-appointed independent special interlocutor for missing children and unmarked graves and burial sites, called this a landmark decision for Canada.\n",
      "\"It was a really significant decision yesterday — a very significant case for the entire country,\" said Murray, who was a third-party intervenor in the hearings, in an interview with CBC News.\n",
      "\"We have situations that are happening across Turtle Island, where similar things are happening, where communities are trying to stop developers until they do the search. Now we have a decision of a court that expresses the importance of taking the time of talking to each other … so that we don't continue to have these disputes moving forward.\" \n",
      "The injunction — effective immediately — stops all excavation on the site for three to four months. Despite the case scheduled to be heard this week, work had recently started on the site. \n",
      "\"That is not helpful for reconciliation,\" Murray said. \"They could have waited until the court case was heard to determine whether to start putting the shovels in the ground. \n",
      "Kahentinetha and Murray hope the decision allows the parties involved to now meet out of court to negotiate a way to protect and respect the site.\n",
      "When reached for comment by CBC News, McGill University forwarded all questions to the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI), which is responsible for the revitalization of the site.\n",
      "Francis Martel, an SQI spokesperson, said excavation in front of the Hersey Pavilion was completed Wednesday. It was done to connect sewer and water lines so as to make the building independent from the former hospital, he said.\n",
      "Archaeological research was carried out before the work began, he said.\n",
      "Archaeologists were on site during each excavation, as were invited representatives of the Indigenous communities, he said. A bioarchaeologist, who specializes in the study of skeletal remains, was also available to provide expertise, Martel said.\n",

      "McGill University and a group of Indigenous elders have reached a deal to search for the possibility of unmarked graves at the former site of a Montreal hospital, following a court ruling described as precedent setting.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers allege there are bodies of Indigenous patients buried on and around the old grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital, which McGill is renovating to expand its campus.\n",
      "“I’m glad that everybody agreed with that, and we all want this to happen and we’re going toward justice,” Kahentinetha, one of the Mohawk Mothers, said in an interview. “We always said we’re here for the children and we want justice for all the children.”\n",
      "The Mothers say they have uncovered evidence of graves following interviews with survivors of mind-control experiments that took place in the 1950s and 1960s at a psychiatric institute affiliated with the hospital. Canada and the United States allegedly funded abusive psychological experiments on vulnerable patients with the MK-ULTRA program, which included experimental drugs, rounds of electroshocks and sleep deprivation.\n",
      "The group filed a civil suit in March 2022, and last October it obtained an injunction ordering a pause on excavation work on the university-expansion project with a judge ruling the renovations would cause irreparable harm. After several mediation sessions, the Mothers and McGill reached a deal on April 6.\n",
      "On Thursday the Quebec Superior Court gave legal status to the agreement that would allow three archaeologists — and one junior archaeologist appointed by the elders — to study the site and identify the proper techniques to look for unmarked graves. The panel will determine which search methods could be used, such as ground-penetrating radar and the use of dogs.\n",
      "Preparatory work began this week with a site visit by archaeologists. The agreement stipulates that if no graves are immediately found then excavation work can begin on a rolling basis and in a sensitive manner in case there is an unexpected discovery.\n",
      "The merits of the case brought by the mothers will be argued at a later date. But in the interim, it’s hoped that the court injunction and agreement will serve as a precedent.\n",
      "Philippe Blouin, an anthropologist and interpreter who assisted the Mothers in court, said the agreement could be used to explore for graves on sites where Indigenous children were sent to — other than residential schools — such as sanatoriums or reformatories.\n",
      "“Why this is important now is because it’s precedent setting .... It directly sets a precedent for a way to proceed when there’s allegations of them (graves),” Blouin said.\n",
      "In a statement, McGill welcomed the agreement, which will allow the university and the provincial body that supports public infrastructure projects — Societe quebecoise des infrastructures — to transform the site into a new research and teaching hub.\n",
      "“This agreement provides for an unprecedented collaboration between the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers), the SQI, and McGill, which will shed light on allegations of the possible presence of unmarked graves on portions of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site,” the university said in a statement.\n",
      "As part of the deal, cultural monitors will also be on site to witness the excavation work and conduct ceremonies as needed.\n",

      "A group of elders from Kahnawake – south of Montreal- known as the Mohawk mothers, were successful in getting a Quebec judge to stop excavation work at an expansion project at Montreal’s Allan Memorial Institute and the old Royal Victoria hospital.\n",
      "The group has alleged that the bodies of Indigenous patients of the institute from the 1950s and 60s are buried at the site scheduled to be redeveloped.\n",
      "“We still suffer over what happened to them, to our children. So it’s overwhelming. And I don’t even know if I can say I’m happy because it makes me sad to know what happened to them and the Inuit children that were brought here from all over and experimented on,” explained Kahentinetha of the Mohawk Mothers, part of the Bear clan.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers represented themselves in court, after filing the request for the injunction in March. It was granted October 27.\n",
      "During the two-day hearings, lawyers representing McGill and the société québécoise des infrastructures, argued that there was no evidence of unmarked graves on the site.\n",
      "But Superior Court Justice Gregory Moore ruled allowing the planned work to go ahead without taking time to develop a proper archeological plan would cause irreparable harm to the Mohawk plaintiffs.\n",
      "“The adversaries understand who we are and what we are, that we’re not after money,” Kahentinetha told CityNews. “No, we’re after justice. And sometimes this is one of the times we actually got some justice.\n",
      "“It’s always an uphill battle for us. And now here we are in the driver’s seat.”\n",
      "The société québécoise des infrastructures told CityNews in a statement, “The SQI reiterates that as part of its mission to support public bodies in the management of their infrastructure projects and since the beginning of the project to requalify the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital, it has been engaged in a process of exchange with the First Nations and it intends to continue on this path.”\n",
      "The judge said the identification of unmarked Indigenous graves is a priority for discovering the truth and working toward reconciliation. Pointing to possible parallels between health services and residential schools.\n",
      "“Everybody has a duty to protect biodiversity,” said Kahentinetha. “And we were all doing it, trying to do it. But now we have an order that says that we’re all going to do it.”\n",
      "McGill University said Tuesday it will begin discussions with the group on the next steps.\n",
      "“This will probably help a lot of people, not just here, but maybe all over the world to find peace,” said Kahentinetha. “Because so many of our people or other people are going through the same thing where the corporations come first and the developers come first and we are, you know, an afterthought. And then so many of us are living in such terrible conditions. And so now that has to stop.”\n",

      "As the Kanien’kehá:ka Kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) close out two days in Quebec’s Superior Court this week, a judge has ruled that the archaeological firm Arkéos must stop digging at the Royal Victoria Hospital site so investigations into the possibility of unmarked graves can take place.\n",
      "The Kahnistensera called six defendants to court regarding the excavations – including McGill University and the Attorney General of Canada – which the judge ruled must be paused so that discussion can be meaningfully facilitated between the Mothers and those responsible for the excavation site.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers brought the case to court to request an interlocutory injunction to stop excavations until proper consent and process has been considered. Archeological firm Arkéos began digging at the site last week.\n",
      "The court sessions kicked off on Wednesday with nearly half an hour wasted changing courtrooms. Though the case was meant to be heard in a room with a large gallery space, occupants were moved to a significantly smaller courtroom. \n",
      "By 9:30 a.m., the room was overflowing, with members of the gallery forced to sit on the floor to witness the case.\n",
      "“This is problematic, respectfully,” said Julian Falconer, lawyer for Special Interlocutor Kimberly Murray. “As I speak, for the record, we see more people trying to cram in…I really ask if you can consider recessing briefly.”\n",
      "The judge refused to recess, and the case stayed in the smaller room for the duration of the hearings. Members of the public remained seated on the floor, despite Falconer’s highlighting of potential fire-code violations, and the fact that the court knew of public interest in the case prior to the day.\n",
      "“It’s to be expected,” said Kwetiio, one of the Kahnistensera. “I don’t let those small things phase me.”\n",
      "As Kwetiio took to the stand, she outlined the importance of the case.\n",
      "“We are doing this for our people to know the truth, which is the first step towards reconciliation,” she said. “At stake is Indigenous Peoples’ trust in Canada and Quebec’s commitment to stop the genocide.”\n",
      "“We are treated as if we are immigrants on our own land, but we are not. “We are Kanien’kehá:ka people,” she told the court.\n",
      "The plaintiffs argued that they have no reason to trust the organizations involved in the excavation process.\n",
      "“The issue is one of trust,” Kwetiio explained. “Can we trust the defendants… Can we trust them for respecting and maintaining the remnants of our history that are in our ground?”\n",
      "Special interlocutor Kimberly Murray noted that this is a historic case, and the first of its type to be heard in a Quebec Superior Court.\n",
      "“I was really concerned about the process, and about parties trying to discredit Indigenous people when they come forward with these allegations,” she said. “We know that their children were taken from Indian residential schools to other hospitals, and the Royal Victoria is one of those hospitals. The documents in the archives show that.”\n",
      "Murray also pointed to one of the affidavits shared in court, where survivor of Allan Institute experiments Lana Ponting recalled seeing guards with shovels. The Allan Institute houses the psychiatry department of the Royal Victoria Hospital, and was formerly used for psychiatric experiments such as MK-Ultra.\n",
      "Pointing remembered living with Indigenous victims, who were also subject to psychological experiments using hallucinogenic drugs, among others.\n",
      "“I found people standing over by the cement wall with shovels. There were rumours that there are bodies buried in Allan property,” the affidavit read. “And I believe some of them would be Indigenous people.”\n",
      "Murray took particular issue with a claim made last week by McGill University’s deputy provost Fabrice Labeau, who noted in a McGill senate session that the site of excavation is in front of the Hersey Pavillion, far from the hospital itself.\n",
      "He noted that this means the likelihood of unmarked graves being found is incredibly small.\n",
      "“That to me doesn’t answer the question, because we know there are patterns,” explained Murray. “There’s been change to the land and the geography of the land, there’ve been changes of buildings and locations.”\n",
      "Murray also explained that current excavations could be out of line with best practices laid out by the Canadian Archaeological Association, which have been particularly important since the discoveries made in Kamloops. Murray noted that the redevelopment project here began before that discovery.\n",
      "When McGill’s lawyer Doug Mitchell took to the stand, he asked the court to trust the defence.\n",
      "“Trust the process,” he said. “Trust McGill.”\n",
      "The majority of the public in the gallery laughed at this request. Kwetiio found the appeal to give McGill a chance baffling.\n",
      "“We have given them several chances,” she said. “I think they’re behind on their chances. And we don’t rely on chances.”\n",
      "At one point, Mitchell gestured towards the Mohawk Mothers, saying, “I think it’s telling, judge, that there are only six plaintiffs here.”\n",
      "He went on to explain that since the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake (MCK) had not disputed the excavation and were not present in court to support the plaintiffs, the Mohawk Mothers’ demands were not reflective of the majority of the Mohawk people’s opinion. He suggested that the MCK’s absence at the case therefore meant that they opposed the Mohawk Mothers’ claims, essentially aligning the Council with the defence in court.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers took issue with this claim.\n",
      "“Each individual person that’s Onkwehón:we stands in their inherent right on their own,” Kwetiio said after the session.\n",
      "MCK has expressed wishes to remain neutral since the outset of the Mohawk Mothers’ project.\n",
      "“We didn’t want to be dragged into this,” said MCK chief Ross Montour. “This is not our project. We are not its proponent. McGill University is. SQI (Société québécoise des infrastructures) is. Nor are we the government of Quebec. Those parties need to defend their project, not the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake.”\n",
      "Montour explained that he has faced similar issues where media outlets have heavily coloured any statements about the case.\n",
      "“It shouldn’t be presented out there that we approved the project,” he added. “What’s really distressing about the whole thing is that we tried to stay out of this as much as possible.”\n",
      "The SQI criticized the “practical consequences” of an injunction preventing the continuation of archeological work on the site.\n",
      "“If an interlocutory injunction preventing renovation was granted every time any hospital was involved in any type of psychiatric experiment involving Indigenous Peoples, we would have a problem,” a lawyer for the SQI said in court.\n",
      "On the second day of the hearing, October 27, McGill’s lawyers reported that Arkéos had completed a brief archeological search the previous day, finding nothing of archeological significance and no bodies. However, the Mohawk Mothers did not believe that this invalidates the need for an injunction.\n",
      "Falconer continues to remind the defence of the lack of precedent in this case.\n",
      "“There is no law that says, ‘Here’s what one must do when past governments sought to hide the remains of children,’” he said. “I’ve never said this in court before, and I’m embarrassed I’m saying this, but we weren’t made for this. We’re failing.”\n",
      "Kwetiio directed a final comment to the court. “Planting a shovel in the bones of our ancestors before you respect protocol, or respect us, is unacceptable.”\n",

      "Cadaver dogs have identified possible evidence of human remains on the grounds of Montreal's old Royal Victoria Hospital, a sprawling network of now-vacant buildings, some dating back 140 years, on Mount Royal's southern flank.\n",
      "The search was conducted as part of an agreement between the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera, a group known in English as the Mohawk Mothers, and McGill University, to determine if there are unmarked graves in an area the university intends to redevelop, turning the heritage site into a modern academic centre.\n",
      "The agreement, which also involves the government of Quebec and the city of Montreal, came after the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera launched a civil lawsuit in March, seeking to halt the development. They argue there may be unmarked Indigenous graves that risked being excavated at the site, as well as archeological remains from a pre-colonial Iroquoian settlement.\n",
      "The site also includes the Allan Memorial Institute, where CIA-funded brainwashing experiments were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. \n",
      "Julian Falconer, the lawyer for the special interlocutor appointed to oversee the search, said Thursday that multiple dogs combing the site had indicated the presence of bodies.\n",
      "\"What the findings by the dogs means is that the dogs trained to identify evidence of human remains have identified that evidence,\" he said. \"That doesn't necessarily mean there are bodies there, it means there is evidence of bodies there.\"\n",
      "The search dogs' findings were presented to Quebec Superior Court Justice Gregory Moore on Thursday, as the women who launched the civil suit argued McGill wasn't providing sufficient security to the site, given the possible presence of unmarked graves and the fact that the school is restricting access to records. \n",
      "Kwetiio, one of the group's members, told the court she was extremely concerned about site security. In recent weeks, cinema trailers were parked in the area, and videos were posted online of people inside the fence, flouting McGill's attempt to protect the site with hired security guards.\n",
      "\"These souls matter,\" Kwetiio said. \"Their lives and their deaths matter. What happens and what we do about it matters.\"\n",
      "Doug Mitchell, a lawyer for McGill University, told the court that the university was respecting its end of the agreement — that archives were being turned over, sufficient security was present at the site, and work there had stopped.\n",
      "Three teams — each consisting of a dog and a handler — surveyed the grounds of the old Royal Victoria in recent weeks. The searches were conducted by the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association.\n",
      "The dogs have been trained, often in cemeteries, to detect decaying human flesh and bone within a six- to 10-metre radius, according to Karonhianoron, a McGill archaeology student appointed by the Kanien'kehá:ka Kahnistensera to monitor the searches, who was present when the dog search was conducted.\n",
      "All three dogs gave a signal when they came near the same stretch of wall near the Hersey Pavilion, which used to be the hospital's nurses residence. \n",
      "\"It felt very surreal,\" Karonhianoron said. \"For me, it wasn't unexpected, but I guess to have concrete evidence to show to people who maybe don't know the whole story about this place, about the Royal Vic and the Allan, that was very powerful for me to sit with.\"\n",
      "Kim Cooper, the team manager at the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association, wrote in a report submitted to the court and obtained by CBC News that she is \"confident that the odour of human remains is in this area.\"\n",
      "\"The proximity of all dogs' indications suggests that, if odour is being blown into the alcove area, it is not being blown in from a significant distance,\" she wrote. \"We can only guess at what 'significant' means in this context, but a reasonable guess would be 10 metres or less.\"\n",
      "Falconer said the evidence of human remains found at the site means that agreement now needs updating. It was originally written, he said, as if the possibility of finding remains was remote, even hypothetical.\n",
      "\"I would say the situation has changed, day to night, on that issue,\" he said. \"Not only is there cause for concern; there is a direct concern.\"\n",

      "This week, archaeological firm Arkéos began investigating the site of the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) on behalf of McGill University. McGill plans to turn the former hospital into a new research and teaching facility, known as the “New Vic Project.” The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the area is archaeologically significant. This work appears to be going ahead despite opposition from the kanien’kehá:ka kahnistensera (Mohawk Mothers) who are currently taking McGill to court to stop the New Vic Project, as they believe the site to contain unmarked Indigenous graves, especially those from the MK-Ultra experiments in the 1960s. On October 10, a settler anarchist group set up an occupation at the site in solidarity with the Mohawk Mothers, but were evicted by police the next day.\n",
      "In an update shared on October 11, the Mohawk Mothers stated that they are “wholly opposed to the archaeological intervention in its current form, which dismisses all the guidelines and frameworks that have been developed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and by archaeologists engaged in searching for unmarked graves since the first findings in Tk’emlúps in 2021.” They say that the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) and McGill previously told them that they wouldn’t start any archaeological interventions until “information meetings” had been completed. \n",

      "Archeological work on the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital and Allan Memorial Institute has begun, with experts mapping the area to search for the remains of Indigenous children in Montreal.\n",
      "The Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera, also known as the Mohawk Mothers, struck an agreement on April 6 with McGill University, the Société québécoise des infrastructures (SQI), the MUHC, the City of Montreal and the Attorney General of Canada to allow for archeological work to be conducted.\n",
      "The Mothers and lawyers for the other parties met in Superior Court Thursday morning to homologate, or give legal status to the agreement.\n",
      "“This is wonderful. We finally got this going. It’s a big relief for us, it’s been a lot of work,” said Kahentinetha, a Mohawk mother.\n",
      "“That is primarily what we are here for, our children, to find out what our history is and to make sure our children are put to rest in the proper way,” said Mohawk mother Kwetiio.\n",
      "The agreement follows the mothers winning an historic injunction in the fall, suspending expansion work on the Royal Victoria hospital site. All sides met several times over the last few months, negotiating and working out an agreement to allow for the searching for remains. The parties agreed to appoint a panel of three archeologists, and a junior student archeologist appointed by the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera.\n",
      "As per the agreement, the panel will study and map the land, and will identify appropriate archeological techniques to be used on various sites to detect if there are any unmarked graves.\n",
      "McGill, the SQI and the Mohawk Mothers agreed to be bound by the recommendations of the panel, and if no graves are found, excavation and construction work can begin.\n",
      "While some experts maintain there are no bodies on the site — as it was never a residential school and was a hospital built on bedrock — the Mohawk Mothers believe children were buried there during experiments in the 1950s and 60s at the Allan Memorial Institute.\n",
      "Quebec Superior Court Justice Gregory Moore permitted 82-year-old Lana Ponting to speak for the mothers during court proceedings Thursday morning, stipulating what she said was not to be admitted as evidence.\n",
      "Ponting suffered through electroshock therapy and other treatments in the 1950s. She claims she saw Indigenous children fed drugs, and believes she saw graves being dug. She flew from Winnipeg to support the Mohawk mothers during their court proceedings.\n",
      "“I remember one night I snuck out. I saw people with shovels,” she said.  “I remember them because they had red handles. They were digging. I firmly believe there are bodies on the property of the Allan Memorial Institute.”\n",
      "In a statement to Global News, spokesman for the SQI Francis Martel said: “The agreement provides for continued collaboration between the Kanien’keha:ka Kahnistensera, the SQI and McGill in an effort to shed light on allegations that there may be burials on the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital.”\n",
      "“This joint effort is based on the appointment of a panel of expert archaeologists……In addition, culturally appropriate measures, such as the presence of cultural monitors on site during archaeological work, will be implemented to ensure that the project is culturally acceptable to Aboriginal communities. The SQI is very pleased to announce the signing of this agreement which will shed light on the allegations of the presence of graves. The agreement will also make it possible to continue development work on this exceptional Montreal site by redeveloping its buildings and contributing to the creation of new green spaces on Mount Royal.”\n",
      "A federally-appointed special interlocutor for missing children and unmarked graves, Kimberly Murray, was involved in that judgement, and the signed agreement. Lawyer Julian Falconer called it historic.\n",
      "“This is a first in Canada, for setting a precedent for how indigenous people can work with the oppressor,” Falconer said. “It’s a complete vindication of the Mohawk mothers and their ways. The work will continue in the presence of cultural monitors offered up by the Mohawk mothers and what you will see is this extraordinary cooperative exercise. It’s a tribute to the courage of the Mohawk mothers.”\n",

      "McGill University said Tuesday it will begin discussions with an Indigenous group that has raised concerns about unmarked graves after a court ruled that excavation work on a university expansion project would cause “irreparable harm.”\n",
      "Justice Gregory Moore last week ordered a halt to any excavation at the former site of the Royal Victoria Hospital until the parties hold discussions to develop an archeological plan to search for graves.\n",
      "“McGill University takes seriously the concerns of Indigenous communities regarding the New Vic project and seeks to better understand how they may be addressed,” Katherine Gombay, a McGill spokesperson, said in an email. She said the university will engage in a conversation with the Indigenous plaintiffs “with humility and in good faith.” The New Vic project is aimed at creating a new research and teaching hub.\n",
      "The judge also granted Kimberly R. Murray, the federally appointed independent special interlocutor for missing children and unmarked graves, intervener status in the case, and Murray told The Canadian Press Friday that she would take part in meetings with the parties.\n",
      "In his written decision released Tuesday, Moore said the identification of unmarked Indigenous graves is a priority for discovering the truth and working toward reconciliation. He cited the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s recommendations on residential school cemeteries and drew a link to the health-care system.\n",
      "“This call to action is drafted in terms of residential schools, but the plaintiff and the special interlocutor have demonstrated the possible parallels between that system and the health services offered to Indigenous peoples,” Moore wrote.\n",
      "The injunction was granted Thursday at the end of a two-day hearing, following a request in March from a group of elders from Kahnawake known as the Mohawk Mothers. The group has alleged that the bodies of Indigenous patients of the Allan Memorial Institute and the Royal Victoria Hospital are buried at the site scheduled to be redeveloped.\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers claimed to have uncovered evidence of burials through interviews with a survivor of the MK-Ultra mind control experiments conducted in the 1950s and 1960s by Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allan Memorial Institute on the Royal Victoria grounds.\n",
      "During the hearing, lawyers representing McGill and the Societe quebecoise des infrastructures, a provincial body that supports public infrastructure projects, argued that there was no evidence of unmarked graves on the site. “Beyond what I consider to be the very firmly held convictions of the plaintiffs, there’s actually very little evidence to support their assertion that there would be graves on the site of the Royal Victoria Hospital,” McGill lawyer Doug Mitchell said.\n",
      "However, in his ruling, the judge referred to a 2016 archeological report prepared for McGill and the infrastructure corporation that suggested Mount Royal was used as a burial site before the arrival of Europeans. The former hospital is on the side of Mount Royal.\n",
      "Moore said the plaintiffs would “suffer irreparable harm if the excavation work is not suspended for the time it takes to develop an appropriate archeological plan to identify any unmarked graves.” He noted that there is no evidence the project would be delayed by the suspension since the construction timetable has not been established.\n",
      "The ruling concludes that there is urgency to respond to the plaintiffs’ “legitimate concerns” about unmarked graves. “Otherwise, the plaintiffs and those who share their concerns will continue to face the trauma that comes from not knowing whether, when, or how their community members’ graves might be disturbed,” the judge wrote.\n",
      "Julian Falconer, the lawyer representing Murray, called Moore’s ruling groundbreaking and said it was tremendously important for Indigenous Peoples that truth and reconciliation were at the heart of his decision.\n",
      "Murray’s affidavit provides the court with recommendations on best practices for undertaking a search for unmarked graves.\n",
      "“The judge has directed that deep dialogue occurs outside of the court, but also as part of the case management process. He also accepted that the information offered by the special interlocutor could be helpful,” Falconer said.\n",

      "A group called the Mohwak Mothers, however, who raised concerns about the possibility of graves of Indigenous children on the site, is not satisfied.\n",
      "“That project [should] be stopped and we need to have an investigation on those lands,” group member Kwetiio told Global News.\n",
      "The group believes the bodies may be linked to controversial psychological experiments conducted there in the ’50s and ’60s that received funding from the Canadian government and the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n",
      "Montreal mayor Valerie Plante agrees that any graves found on the site must be treated with respect.\n",
      "“We need to make sure,” she stressed.  “If there’s any doubts, if we think that there maybe potentially graves there, we need to do it right.”\n",
      "The Mohawk Mothers say they feel insulted that the OCPM gave the the project the green light and that they and the community should be consulted more before any work is done.\n",
      "Last March, the group filed a motion in Quebec Superior Court to stop the work on the site.\n",
      "“We’re going to court next Monday to set the schedule for it and we will challenge everything,” Kahentinetha said.\n",
      "They said they vow to keep fighting.\n",

      "To challenge a giant head on is one thing. To do it representing yourselves in a foreign system, with no lawyers and nothing but a hunch, powerful protective instincts and bravery, is quite another.\n",
      "But that’s what the Kahnistensera Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk Mothers) group has done, forcing the McGill University dig at the former Royal Victoria Hospital to stop after a judge ruled more time was needed to look into allegations from the istas.\n",
      "In other words, there very well may be unmarked graves of Kanien’kehá:ka people, as the Mothers allege, and only time will tell.\n",
      "It’s an unprecedented move by a court that typically dismisses claims by a group without legal representation.\n",
      "It’s important to point out that not everyone agrees with the group in Kahnawake – some have come out and said so, for their own reasons – but if there ends up being graves there, the fight will have been worth the sacrifice and the long battle against Goliath.\n",
      "It made us think, however, that no matter what the outcome, EVERY dig in the city, the province, the country – especially one that was known to have artifacts, remains, and other related effects to our nation – needs real oversight.\n",
      "The city should institute such a committee at their own expense led by our people to further illustrate their commitment to this thing they call reconciliation.\n",
      "It’s the only way to preserve our history in this area – yes, naysayers, we were here for thou- sands and thousands of years, and weren’t just located in the Mohawk Valley – and to show they really want to honour us now as well as the graves of our ancestors.\n",
      "But we know money takes precedence over respect for Indigenous Peoples, and trying to convince a giant like Montreal to be led by Indigenous Tawits (Davids) is an uphill battle at best.\n",
      "It will slow down production and the economy, they will say. It would be impossible to do any- thing if something like an over- sight committee were erected, they will argue, but we will point to the fact that this is still unceded land, and we were never properly consulted or compensated for the hundreds of trillions of dollars we lost while the city was being erected on stolen ground.\n",
      "Besides, with huge projects all coming to a head at the same time – hello there, Lafontaine Tunnel – it’s not like the city itself has a good handle on building itself up efficiently, with minor inconvenience to the ones who live and visit there.\n",
      "Overlooking new building sites would become part of the process, and, once we have leaders who can really tackle the giants that are right next-door, reparations should not be far behind.\n",
      "Cripple your economy? How about supporting ours? We still haven’t fully explored that elephant in the room and it isn’t going to go away as long as independent, community-minded newspapers like The Eastern Door are around.\n",
      "We won’t let them forget, but we need help, of course.\n",
      "So the Kahnistensera Kanien’kehá:ka opened up a can of worms – although they weren’t exactly welcomed or supported by all at the beginning (or even now by some corners of the community) – that could very well change the course of history.\n",
      "A fight this big draws a line in the sand by demonstrating we were here first, this is our land, and we won’t stop fighting for it. It’s always a good day to remind everyone of those facts, especially the ones who walk among us and doubt our very real claims to Montreal.\n",
      "The fight is just beginning and the Mothers showed their resolve to keep going, in spite of obstacles, ridicule, and dirty tricks by the McGill lawyer who tried to paint them as a renegade group not supported by the Mohawk Council or community.\n",
      "As someone once said, tongue in cheek, “We’re Mohawks. Even we can’t tell our people what to do.”\n"
