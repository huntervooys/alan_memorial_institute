A Quebec Superior Court judge has granted an emergency injunction to stop excavation work on @RVH in Montreal as requested by @MohawkMothers.
The group, called @MohawkMothers, believes there may be unmarked graves of Indigenous people, including children, on or near @RVH following @CIA funded brainwashing experiments in the 1950s and 1960s.
They say @RVH may also house archeological remains from the first pre-colonial Iroquois village.
@MohawkMothers filed a civil suit in March demanding the suspension of @McGill redevelopment plans for part of @RVH.
After two days of hearings this week, a judge issued an oral decision Thursday afternoon in @MohawkMother's favour, granting the emergency, temporary injunction they requested.
Kahentinetha, who is part of @MohawkMothers and a member of the Bear Clan in Kahnawà:ke, said when the decision was read, a lawyer turned around to tell her that she had just made history. 
"We were so excited. We couldn't even understand what had happened," said Kahentinetha
@MohawkMothers has been demanding the suspension of @NVP for the past year. 
She said the win signifies dignity for her people. 
"It maybe represents that this whole issue of the genocide that happened to us, which has been pushed under the rug, is going to come back out now, because now we have the means," said Kahentinetha.
Kimberly Murray, a federally-appointed independent special interlocutor for missing children and unmarked graves and burial sites, called this a landmark decision for Canada.
"It was a really significant decision yesterday — a very significant case for the entire country," said Murray, who was a third-party intervenor in the hearings, in an interview with CBC News.
"We have situations that are happening across Turtle Island, where similar things are happening, where communities are trying to stop developers until they do the search. Now we have a decision of a court that expresses the importance of taking the time of talking to each other … so that we don't continue to have these disputes moving forward." 
The injunction — effective immediately — stops all excavation on @RVH for three to four months. Despite the case scheduled to be heard this week, work had recently started on @RVH. 
"That is not helpful for reconciliation," Murray said. "They could have waited until the court case was heard to determine whether to start putting the shovels in the ground. 
Kahentinetha and Murray hope the decision allows the parties involved to now meet out of court to negotiate a way to protect and respect @RVH.
When reached for comment by CBC News, @McGill forwarded all questions to @SQI, which is responsible for the revitalization of @RVH.
Francis Martel, an @SQI spokesperson, said excavation in front of the Hersey Pavilion was completed Wednesday.
It was done to connect sewer and water lines so as to make the building independent from @RVH, he said.
Archaeological research was carried out before the work began, he said.
Archaeologists were on site during each excavation, as were invited representatives of the Indigenous communities, he said.
A bioarchaeologist, who specializes in the study of skeletal remains, was also available to provide expertise, Martel said.
@SQI has held meetings with members of the local Indigenous communities and other interested stakeholders over the past few days, and everything was communicated through an Oct. 3 newsletter that was widely distributed, he said. 
If significant archaeological remains were uncovered, the work would have been interrupted and measures to protect the remains would have been applied, he added.
@SQI is developing a master plan for @RVH in collaboration with @McGill, the Ministry of Culture and the city of Montreal, he said.
@SQI will also continue to keep Indigenous communities and all other stakeholders informed if other work must be done on the hospital site, said Martel.
