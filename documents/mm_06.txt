@MohawkMothers, also known as the Kahnistensera, held a press conference at the corner of avenue des Pins and Doctor Penfield on September 12, 2023, at 2:30pm. 
The Kahnistensera filed an Emergency Motion to halt drilling and excavation at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, which will be heard on Thursday September 14 at the Superior Court in Montreal. The Emergency Motion details breaches to the Settlement Agreement by McGill and the SQI that @MohawkMothers repeatedly raised in direct talks about significant concerns with the way they are handling the archaeological investigation ordered by the Quebec Superior Court to search for unmarked graves of victims of medical experiments.
The Kahnistensera are shocked and disappointed that McGill University and the Société Québécoise des infrastructures (SQI) have pressed ahead with construction on September 11, 2023 by drilling a large number of holes marking the beginning of a series of excavations. 
The same day, McGill University issued a message to all its staff and students, declaring that the investigation of the zone where they want to start work is complete, and produced no evidence of graves. @MohawkMothers see these developments as major provocations, as the investigation is far from complete and McGill’s messaging predominantly emphasizes favourable findings while concurrently concealing or downplaying several discoveries that confirm the possibility of unmarked burials at the New Vic site. These discoveries require further follow-up to determine whether the New Vic development work can safely proceed.
