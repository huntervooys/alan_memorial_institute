@MohawkMothers staged a protest on Mount-Royal Wednesday against Pope Francis' historic visit to Canada.
@MohawkMothers said an apology for residential schools is an insult and what @MohawkMothers want instead is action.
That cross is a symbol of the oppression, @MohawkMothers say, that the Catholic Church inflicted upon Indigenous communities through residential schools and other means.
@MohawkMothers said removing it would be one concrete way to acknowledge that.
On Wednesday, Pope Francis landed in Quebec City as part of his six-day tour in Canada to apologize for the harm done by the Catholic Church in Canada's residential school system.
The cross on Mount-Royal has been there for nearly a century. 
It commemorates the date on Jan. 6, 1643, when Paul de Chomedey, also known as the sieur de Maisonneuve, kept his promise to carry a wooden cross to the summit of Mount-Royal if the young colony of the Ville-Marie fort survived.
The cross stands 30 metres high and when lit at night it can be seen from kilometres away.
It is usually lit in white, but it can be purple to mark the death and election of a new Pope.
But for @MohawkMothers and others gathered in protest, the cross is a glaring reminder of all the terrible things the Catholic Church has done to Indigenous people.
@MohawkMothers say the Pope's visit is a waste of time and money and want concrete actions of reparations to Indigenous people for all the land that was taken from them.
"I would like that cross to be taken down. If you just look behind you, all of you, if you were to take a look around all the amounts of crosses that you see," said Kwetiio, one of @MohawkMothers.
"There's a symbol of that power that comes over us. And that's just cruel."
@MohawkMothers have a slew of demands. 
One of them would be to consult Indigenous groups on development projects on Mount-Royal, for example, with @NVP that @McGill has planned for @RVH.
