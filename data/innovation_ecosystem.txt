Across its campuses, McGill has many of the necessary ingredients to take on sustainability challenges. 
Multidisciplinary teams are already working with research and industry partners, both locally and globally… and they are just getting started.
The New Vic will significantly increase our capacity to put this talent and infrastructure together in one place — to give a physical home to this community of learning and practice.  
The project is a major piece of McGill’s Master Plan and will allow the entire University to continue evolving, enabling 21st century research and teaching methods to be developed, tested, and put into practice. 
Imagine an environment where a student or a researcher can participate in the design and fabrication of a novel biodegradable plastic, and see it move seamlessly from the computer model, to prototype, to market—sharing spaces and ideas with green chemists, programmers, industry partners, alumni mentors, and policymakers at every step of the way.
Unique learning experiences will become commonplace at the New Vic thanks to dynamic learning spaces, courses, and programs that will stimulate a revolution in pedagogy and prepare students to tackle complex problems in new ways.
Young people already have the ideas and motivation to change the world. 
They have their eyes on the impact they can make, such as rapid transitioning to low or zero carbon economies, and addressing climate change and its outcomes. 
McGill fuels this drive and the New Vic will accelerate this work. 
We will continue to take our future leaders beyond expertise alone, nurturing their capacity for collaboration, creativity, and resilience.
