Mohawk Mothers won several court injunctions to stop construction and investigate unmarked graves at McGill University. 
McGill has fought them every step of the way. 
Read the updates for details of the egregious assault committed against the Mohawk Mothers working at the site on July 25th, 2023.
By now, most people know that some Canadian institutions buried children in unmarked graves on site. 
These deaths were most likely caused by human medical experimentation, starvation, beating, sexual abuse, terror, illness and a 1000 other reasons that one only needs to imagine in the dark recesses of the human mind.
Now, McGill University wants to renovate its lands without consultation or consent with the Mohawk Mothers of Quebec. 
Evidence exists that first nations children were among the many peoples used in illegal dark lab medical/military experiments done on unsuspecting patients of Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allan Memorial Institute, at the Royal Victoria Hospital. 
Testimony exists that children were disposed of on site at the location in Montreal, Canada.
Families of victims of the Montreal Experiments stand with the Mohawk Mothers of Montreal in demanding independent investigations into the allegations to resolve the matter.
While 1000's of apologies and compensation packages for lesser crimes exist, the victims of the Montreal Experiments, are still waiting for justice. 
Please join us to let McGill University know that the cover up and denial ends now.
Please support our call for justice today through moral imperative or legal injunction on McGill University to stop renovations that will destroy evidence forever if not investigated properly.
